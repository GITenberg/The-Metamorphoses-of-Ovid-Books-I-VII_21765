INTRODUCTION.</a></h4>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The</span> Metamorphoses of Ovid are a
compendium of the Mythological narratives of ancient Greece and Rome, so
ingeniously framed, as to embrace a large amount of information upon
almost every subject connected with the learning, traditions, manners,
and customs of antiquity, and have afforded a fertile field of
investigation to the learned of the civilized world. To present to the
public a faithful translation of a work, universally esteemed, not only
for its varied information, but as being the masterpiece of one of the
greatest Poets of ancient Rome, is the object of the present volume.</p>

<p>To render the work, which, from its nature and design, must, of
necessity, be replete with matter of obscure meaning, more inviting to
the scholar, and more intelligible to those who are unversed in
Classical literature, the translation is accompanied with Notes and
Explanations, which, it is believed, will be found to throw considerable
light upon the origin and meaning of some of the traditions of heathen
Mythology.</p>

<p>In the translation, the text of the Delphin edition has been
generally adopted; and no deviation has been made from it, except in a
few instances, where the reason for such a step is stated in the notes;
at the same time, the texts of Burmann and Gierig have throughout been
carefully consulted. The several editions vary materially in respect to
punctuation; the Translator has consequently used his own discretion in
adopting that which seemed to him the most fully to convey in each
passage the intended meaning of the writer.</p>

<p>The Metamorphoses of Ovid have been frequently translated into the
English language. On referring to Mr. Bohn’s excellent Catalogue of the
Greek and Latin Classics and their Translations, we find that the whole
of the work has been twice translated into English Prose, while five
translations in Verse are there enumerated. A&nbsp;prose version of the
Metamorphoses was published by Joseph Davidson, about the
<span class = "pagenum bell">iv</span>
middle of the last century, which professes to be “as near the original
as the different idioms of the Latin and English will allow;” and to be
“printed for the use of schools, as well as of private gentlemen.”
A&nbsp;few moments’ perusal of this work will satisfy the reader that it
has not the slightest pretension to be considered a literal translation,
while, by its departure from the strict letter of the author, it has
gained nothing in elegance of diction. It is accompanied by “critical,
historical, geographical, and classical notes in English, from the best
Commentators, both ancient and modern, beside a great number of notes,
entirely new;” but notwithstanding this announcement, these annotations
will be found to be but few in number, and, with some exceptions in the
early part of the volume, to throw very little light on the obscurities
of the text. A&nbsp;fifth edition of this translation was published so
recently as 1822, but without any improvement, beyond the furbishing up
of the old-fashioned language of the original preface. A&nbsp;far more
literal translation of the Metamorphoses is that by John Clarke, which
was first published about the year 1735, and had attained to a seventh
edition in 1779. Although this version may be pronounced very nearly to
fulfil the promise set forth in its title page, of being “as literal as
possible,” still, from the singular inelegance of its style, and the
fact of its being couched in the conversational language of the early
part of the last century, and being unaccompanied by any attempt at
explanation, it may safely be pronounced to be ill adapted to the
requirements of the present age. Indeed, it would not, perhaps, be too
much to assert, that, although the translator may, in his own words,
“have done an acceptable service to such gentlemen as are desirous of
regaining or improving the skill they acquired at school,” he has, in
many instances, burlesqued rather than translated his author. Some of
the curiosities of his version will be found set forth in the notes;
but, for the purpose of the more readily justifying this assertion, a
few of them are adduced: the word “nitidus” is always rendered “neat,”
whether applied to a fish, a cow, a chariot, a laurel, the steps of a
temple, or the art of wrestling. He renders “horridus,” “in a rude
pickle;” “virgo” is generally translated “the young lady;” “vir” is “a
gentleman;” “senex” and “senior” are indifferently “the old blade,” “the
old fellow,”
<span class = "pagenum bell">v</span>
or “the old gentleman;” while “summa arx” is “the very tip-top.”
“Misera” is “poor soul;” “exsilio” means “to bounce forth;” “pellex” is
“a miss;” “lumina” are “the peepers;” “turbatum fugere” is “to scower
off in a mighty bustle;” “confundor” is “to be jumbled;” and “squalidus”
is “in a sorry pickle.” “Importuna” is “a plaguy baggage;” “adulterium”
is rendered “her pranks;” “ambages” becomes either “a long rabble of
words,” “a long-winded detail,” or “a tale of a tub;” “miserabile
carmen” is “a dismal ditty;” “increpare hos” is “to rattle these
blades;” “penetralia” means “the parlour;” while “accingere,” more
literally than elegantly, is translated “buckle to.” “Situs” is “nasty
stuff;” “oscula jungere” is “to tip him a kiss;” “pingue ingenium” is a
circumlocution for “a blockhead;” “anilia instrumenta” are “his old
woman’s accoutrements;” and “repetito munere Bacchi” is conveyed to the
sense of the reader as, “they return again to their bottle, and take the
other glass.” These are but a specimen of the blemishes which disfigure
the most literal of the English translations of the Metamorphoses.</p>

<p>In the year 1656, a little volume was published, by J[ohn]
B[ulloker,] entitled “Ovid’s Metamorphosis, translated grammatically,
and, according to the propriety of our English tongue, so far as grammar
and the verse will bear, written chiefly for the use of schools, to be
used according to the directions in the preface to the painfull
schoolmaster, and more fully in the book called, ‘Ludus Literarius, or
the Grammar school, chap. 8.’” Notwithstanding a title so pretentious,
it contains a translation of no more than the first 567 lines of the
first Book, executed in a fanciful and pedantic manner; and its rarity
is now the only merit of the volume. A&nbsp;literal interlinear
translation of the first Book “on the plan recommended by Mr. Locke,”
was published in 1839, which had been already preceded by “a selection
from the Metamorphoses of Ovid, adapted to the Hamiltonian system, by a
literal and interlineal translation,” published by James Hamilton, the
author of the Hamiltonian system. This work contains selections only
from the first six books, and consequently embraces but a very small
portion of the entire work.</p>

<p>For the better elucidation of the different fabulous narratives and
allusions, explanations have been added, which
<span class = "pagenum bell">vi</span>
are principally derived from the writings of Herodotus, Apollodorus,
Pausanias, Dio Cassius, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Strabo, Hyginus,
Nonnus, and others of the historians, philosophers, and mythologists of
antiquity. A&nbsp;great number of these illustrations are collected in
the elaborate edition of Ovid, published by the Abbé Banier, one of the
most learned scholars of the last century; who has, therein, and in his
“Explanations of the Fables of Antiquity,” with indefatigable labour and
research, culled from the works of ancient authors, all such information
as he considered likely to throw any light upon the Mythology and
history of Greece and Rome.</p>

<p>This course has been adopted, because it was considered that a
statement of the opinions of contemporary authors would be the most
likely to enable the reader to form his own ideas upon the various
subjects presented to his notice. Indeed, except in two or three
instances, space has been found too limited to allow of more than an
occasional reference to the opinions of modern scholars. Such being the
object of the explanations, the reader will not be surprised at the
absence of critical and lengthened discussions on many of those moot
points of Mythology and early history which have occupied, with no very
positive result, the attention of Niebuhr, Lobeck, Müller, Buttmann, and
many other scholars of profound learning.</p>

four Elements: to these their respective inhabitants are assigned, and
man is created from earth and water. The four Ages follow, and in the
last of these the Giants aspire to the sovereignty of the heavens; being
slain by Jupiter, a new race of men springs up from their blood. These
becoming noted for their impiety, Jupiter not only transforms Lycaon
into a wolf, but destroys the whole race of men and animals by a Deluge,
with the exception of Deucalion and Pyrrha, who, when the waters have
abated, renew the human race, by throwing stones behind them. Other
animated beings are produced by heat and moisture: and, among them, the
serpent Python. Phœbus slays him, and institutes the Pythian games as a
memorial of the event, in which the conquerors are crowned with beech;
for as yet the laurel does not exist, into which Daphne is changed soon
after, while flying from Phœbus. On this taking place, the other rivers
repair to her father Peneus, either to congratulate or to console him;
but Inachus is not there, as he is grieving for his daughter Io, whom
Jupiter, having first ravished her, has changed into a cow. She is
entrusted by Juno to the care of Argus; Mercury having first related to
him the transformation of the Nymph Syrinx into reeds, slays him, on
which his eyes are placed by Juno in the tail of the peacock. Io, having
recovered human shape, becomes the mother of Epaphus.</p>

a proof of his affection towards his child, to allow him the guidance of
the

chariot of the Sun for one day. This being granted, the whole earth is
set on fire by him, and the Æthiopians are turned black by the heat.
Jupiter strikes Phaëton with a thunderbolt, and while his sisters and
his kinsman Cyenus are lamenting him, the former are changed into trees,
and Cyenus into a swan. On visiting the earth, that he may repair the
damage caused by the conflagration, Jupiter sees Calisto, and, assuming
the form of Diana, he debauches her. Juno, being enraged, changes
Calisto into a bear; and her own son Arcas being about to pierce her
with an arrow, Jupiter places them both among the Constellations. Juno
having complained of this to Oceanus, is borne back to the heavens by
her peacocks, who have so lately changed their colour; a thing which has
also happened to the raven, which has been lately changed from white to
black, he having refused to listen to the warnings of the crow (who
relates the story of its own transformation, and of that of Nyctimene
into an owl), and having persisted in informing Phœbus of the intrigues
of Coronis. Her son Æsculapius being cut out of the womb of Coronis and
carried to the cave of Chiron the Centaur, Ocyrrhoë, the daughter of
Chiron, is changed into a mare, while she is prophesying. Her father in
vain invokes the assistance of Apollo, for he, in the guise of a
shepherd, is tending his oxen in the country of Elis. He neglecting his
herd, Mercury takes the opportunity of stealing it; after which he
changes Battus into a touchstone, for betraying him. Flying thence,
Mercury beholds Herse, the daughter of Cecrops, and debauches her. Her
sister Aglauros, being envious of her, is changed into a rock. Mercury
returns to heaven, on which Jupiter orders him to drive the herds of
Agenor towards the shore; and then, assuming the form of a bull, he
carries Europa over the sea to the isle of Crete.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Agenor</span> commands his son Cadmus to
seek his sister Europa. While he is doing this, he slays a dragon in
Bœotia; and having sowed its teeth in the earth, men are produced, with
whose assistance he builds the walls of Thebes. His first cause of grief
is the fate of his grandson Actæon, who, being changed into a stag, is
torn to pieces by his own hounds. This, however, gives pleasure to Juno,
who hates not only Semele, the daughter of Cadmus, and the favourite of
Jupiter, but all the house of Agenor as well. Assuming the form of
Beroë, she contrives the destruction of Semele by the lightnings of
Jupiter; while Bacchus, being saved alive from his mother’s womb, is
brought up on the earth. Jupiter has a discussion with Juno on the
relative pleasures of the sexes, and they agree to
<span class = "pagenum bell">ix</span>
refer the question to Tiresias, who has been of both sexes. He gives his
decision in favour of Jupiter, on which Juno deprives him of sight; and,
by way of recompense, Jupiter bestows on him the gift of prophesy. His
first prediction is fulfilled in the case of Narcissus, who, despising
the advances of all females (in whose number is Echo, who has been
transformed into a sound), at last pines away with love for himself, and
is changed into a flower which bears his name. Pentheus, however,
derides the prophet; who predicts his fate, and his predictions are soon
verified; for, on the celebration of the orgies, Bacchus having assumed
a disguise, is brought before him; and having related to Pentheus the
story of the transformation of the Etrurian sailors into dolphins, he is
thrown into prison. On this, Pentheus is torn in pieces by the
Bacchanals, and great respect is afterwards paid to the rites of
Bacchus.</p>

jealous of her sister, was transformed into a sun-flower; and how
Salmacis and Hermaphroditus had become united into one body. After this,
through the agency of Bacchus, the sisters are transformed into bats,
and their webs are changed into vines. Ino rejoicing at this, Juno, in
her hatred and indignation, sends one of the Furies to her, who causes
her to be struck with insanity, on which she leaps into the sea, with
her son Melicerta in her arms; but by the intercession of Venus, they
become sea Deities, and their Sidonian attendants, who are bewailing
them as dead, are changed into rocks. Cadmus, afflicted at this fresh
calamity, retires from Thebes, and flies to Illyria, together with his
wife, where they are both transformed into serpents. Of those who
despise Bacchus, Acrisius alone remains, the grandfather of Perseus,
who, having cut off the head of the Gorgon Medusa, serpents are produced
by her blood. Perseus turns Atlas into a mountain, and having liberated
Andromeda, he changes sea-weed into coral, and afterwards marries
her.</p>

On learning this, while one person relates the transformation by Latona

INTRODUCTION.</a></h4>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">P. Ovidius Naso</span>&mdash;commonly known
as Ovid&mdash;was born at Sulmo, about<ins class = "correction" title =
"comma in original">, </ins>ninety miles from Rome, in the year
43&nbsp;B.C. His father belonged to an old equestrian family, and at an
early age brought his son to Rome, where he was educated under the most
distinguished masters. Very little is known of the poetís life, except
that which is gathered from his own writings. After finishing his
education at home he visited Athens, in company with the poet Macer, for
the purpose of completing his studies, and before returning visited the
magnificent cities of Asia Minor and spent nearly a year in Sicily.</p>

<p>Although as a young man Ovid showed a natural taste and inclination
for poetical composition, he was by no means encouraged to indulge in
this pursuit. His father thought that the profession of law was much
more apt to lead to distinction and political eminence than the vocation
of a poet. He therefore dissuaded his son from writing poetry and urged
him to devote himself to the legal profession. Compliance with his
father’s wishes led him to spend much time in the forum, and for a while
poetry was abandoned. Upon attaining his majority,
<span class = "pagenum mckay">vi</span>
he held several minor offices of state; but neither his health nor his
inclinations would permit him to perform the duties of public life.
Poetry was his love, and in spite of the strong objections of his
father, he resolved to abandon the law courts and devote himself to a
more congenial occupation. He sought the society of the most
distinguished poets of the day, and his admiration for them amounted
almost to reverence. He numbered among his intimate friends the poets
Macer, Propertius, Ponticus and Bassus, while Æmilius Macer, Virgil’s
contemporary, used to read his compositions to him, and even the
fastidious Horace, it is said, occasionally delighted the young man’s
ear with the charm of his verse.</p>

<p>Ovid was married three times. His first wife he married when little
more than a boy, and the union does not seem to have been a happy one,
though it was probably due to no fault of the wife. His second wife
seems also to have been of blameless character, but his love for her was
of short duration. His third wife was a lady of the great Fabian house
and a friend of the Empress Livia. She appears to have been a woman in
every way worthy of the great and lasting love which the poet lavished
upon her to the day of his death.</p>

<p>Up to the age of fifty Ovid had lived a life of prosperity and
happiness. Though not a wealthy man, his means were such as to permit
him to indulge in the luxuries of refined life, and his attainments as
<span class = "pagenum mckay">vii</span>
a poet had surrounded him with a circle of most desirable friends and
admirers. He had even obtained the favor and patronage of the royal
family. About the year 8 A.D. he, however, incurred the great
displeasure of Augustus, and was ordered by him to withdraw from Rome
and dwell in the colony of Tomi, on the shore of the Euxine sea. Leaving
behind him a wife to whom he was devotedly attached he obeyed the edict
of his emperor and entered upon an exile from which he was destined
never to return. He died in banishment at Tomi in the year 18 A.D.</p>

<p>The exact reason for Ovid’s banishment has never been clear, though
there have been many conjectures as to the cause. About two years
previous to his exile Ovid had published a composition which had greatly
displeased Augustus, on account of its immoral tendency. Almost
coincident with this publication was the discovery of the scandal
relating to Julia, daughter of the emperor. It is probable that the
proximity of these two events tended to intensify the imperial
displeasure, and when some time later there was made public the intrigue
of the emperor’s granddaughter, the indignation of Augustus gave itself
vent in the banishment of Ovid.</p>

<p>The writings of Ovid consist of the <i>Amores</i> in three books; the
<i>Heroic Epistles</i>, twenty-one in number; the <i>Ars Amatoria</i>;
the <i>Remedia Amoris</i>; the <i>Metamorphoses</i>, in fifteen books;
the <i>Fasti</i>, in
<span class = "pagenum mckay">viii</span>
six books; the <i>Tristia</i>, in five books; the <i>Epistles</i>, in
four books, and a few minor poems. In the following pages will be found
a translation of the <i>Metamorphoses</i>.</p>

“There is a growing disapprobation, both in Great Britain and America,
of the disproportionate length of time devoted by the youthful student
to the acquisition of the dead languages; and therefore nothing will
tend so effectually to the preservation of the Greek and Latin grammars
as their judicious union (the fruit of an intelligent compromise) with
the Interlinear Classics.”</p>

More about the texts</a></h5>

<p>Ovid’s <i>Metamorphoses</i>, translated by Henry Thomas Riley
(1816-1878, B.A. 1840, M.A. 1859), was originally published in 1851 as
part of Bohn’s Classical Library. This e-text, covering Books I-VII, is
based on two reprints:</p>

<p class = "inset">
George Bell (London, 1893, one volume). This edition describes itself as
“reprinted from the stereotype plates”. These may have been the original
1851 plates; the <i>Classical Library</i> was sold to Bell &amp; Daldy,
later George Bell.</p>

<p class = "inset">
David McKay (Philadelphia, 1899, two volumes), with introduction by
Edward Brooks. The introductory material from the Bell/Bohn edition is
absent. This edition was freshly typeset, correcting a few errors in the
Bell/Bohn edition but also introducing a number of new errors.</p>

<p>The McKay edition was the “base” of the e-text. The scanned,
proofread text was computer-checked against the text of the Bell
edition, and differences were in turn checked against page images of the
printed books. Where appropriate, the text was checked against one or
more versions of the Latin original. Most differences are trivial. McKay
uses American spelling such as “honor” for “honour”, and compound forms
such as “northwest” for “north-west”; punctuation is often changed,
though some apparent variations may be due to the quality of printing
and reproduction.</p>

<p>Note that the title page of the Bell edition lists the translator as
“Henry T. Riley, B.A.”, while the McKay edition has “M.A.” The sequence
of dates&mdash;original publication 1851, Riley M.A. 1859, reprint
1893&mdash;supports the idea that the Bell edition is a strict
facsimile.</p>

<h5><a name = "errors" id = "errors">
Errors and Variations</a></h5>

<p><b>Changes</b> to the text are shown with mouse-hover popups, marked
in three ways:</p>

<p class = "inset">
&mdash;Errors shared by <ins class = "corr both" title = "both texts have ‘error’">both editions</ins>.<br>
&mdash;Errors introduced in the <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay has ‘error’">McKay edition</ins>. This is the largest group; in
particular, the typesetter appears not to have known Greek, and had
trouble distinguishing between <i>œ</i> and <i>æ</i>. Unless otherwise
noted, the Bell version was treated as the correct form.<br>
&mdash;<ins class = "corr bell" title = "Bell has ‘error’">Errors</ins>
in the Bell/Bohn edition corrected in McKay, and <ins class = "corr
bell" title = "Bell translates ‘different’">variant readings</ins> where
the McKay text was used. Variant readings are “wrong” in the sense that
they are different from what is found in the Bell/Bohn text, but they
are acceptable translations of the Latin.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Italics</b> in the translation&mdash;shown with braces {&nbsp;} in
the correction popups&mdash;are considered non-trivial because they
indicate text added by the translator, not present in the Latin
original. More complex errors and ambiguities are addressed in
supplementary footnotes marked by letters: <sup>A,&nbsp;B</sup>.
Numbered footnotes are from the original text.</p>

<p><b>Dieresis</b> is unpredictable in both editions; forms such as
“Phaeton”, “Ocyrrhöe” and “Danäe” are common, and have been silently
corrected. Since the ligatures “æ” and “œ” are used consistently,
dieresis can be assumed even when not explicitly indicated.</p>

<p>The translator used a number of less common name forms and variant
spellings:</p>

<p class = "inset">
Cæus, Calisto, Lilybœus, Phyale, Phryxus, Progne:<br>
The original, Greek-derived forms are Cœus (Κοιος), Callisto (Καλλιστω),
Lilybæus (Λιλυβαιος), Phiale (Φιαλη), Phrixus (Φριξος), Procne (Προκνη).
Note that in the main text, the name “Callisto” is never used, probably
on metrical grounds.</p>

<p class = "inset">
Damasicthon, Erectheus <i>and similar</i>:<br>
Spellings in “-cth-” are used consistently in place of “-chth-” (Greek
-χθ-).</p>

<p class = "inset">
The pairs Achæa/Achaia, Ethiopia/Æthiopia, Phocea/Phocæa,
Proserpine/Proserpina all occur, with the McKay text following Bell in
all cases.</p>


<h5><a name = "footnotes" id = "footnotes">
Footnote Numbering</a></h5>

<p>In the original text, footnote numbers began from 1 in each Book, and
started over when the count passed 99. Almost all Books had duplications
in the sequence, usually in the form “17*”. There were no changes
between the two editions. In this e-text, footnotes have been renumbered
consecutively within each Book, without duplication; Books I and VII
continue past 100.</p>

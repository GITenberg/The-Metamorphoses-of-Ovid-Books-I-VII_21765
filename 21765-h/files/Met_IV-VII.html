celebrating the festival of Bacchus, apply themselves to other pursuits
during the ceremonies; and among several narratives which they relate to
pass away the time, they divert themselves with the story of the
adventures of Pyramus and Thisbe. These lovers having made an
appointment to meet without the walls of Babylon, Thisbe arrives first;
but at the sight of a lioness, she runs to hide herself in a cave, and
in her alarm, drops her veil. Pyramus, arriving soon after, finds the
veil of his mistress stained with blood; and believing her to be dead,
kills himself with his own sword. Thisbe returns from the cave; and
finding Pyramus weltering in his blood, she plunges the same fatal
weapon into her own breast.</p>

<p>The daughters of Minyas alone, within doors, interrupting the
festival with unseasonable labor,<a class = "tag" name = "tag4_14" id =

the threads with their fingers, or are plying at the web, and keeping
the handmaids to their work. One of them, <i>as she is</i> drawing the

thronging to <i>these</i> fanciful rites, let us, whom Pallas,

with varying discourse; and let us relate by turns to our disengaged

first acquaintance, and their first advances <i>in love</i>; with time
their affection increased. They would have united themselves, too, by
the tie of marriage, but their fathers forbade it. A&nbsp;thing which
they could not forbid, they were both inflamed, with minds equally
captivated. There is no one acquainted with it; by nods and signs, they
hold converse. And the more the fire is smothered, the more, when
<i>so</i> smothered, does it burn. The party-wall, common to the two
houses, was cleft by a small chink, which it had got formerly, when it
was
<span class = "pagenum bell">122</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">IV. 66-99</span>
built. This defect, remarked by no one for so many ages, you lovers
(what does not love perceive?) first found one, and you made it a
passage for your voices, and the accents of love used to pass through it
in safety, with the gentlest murmur. Oftentimes, after they had taken
their stations, Thisbe on one side, <i>and</i> Pyramus on the other, and
the breath of their mouths had been <i>mutually</i> caught by turns,
they used to say, ‘Envious wall, why dost thou stand in the way of
lovers? what great matter were it, for thee to suffer us to be joined
with our entire bodies? Or if that is too much, that, at least, thou
shouldst open, for the exchange of kisses. Nor are we ungrateful; we
confess that we are indebted to thee, that a passage has been given for
our words to our loving ears<ins class = "corr both" title = "both texts missing close quote">.’</ins> Having said this much, in vain, on their
respective sides, about night they said, ‘Farewell’; and gave those
kisses each on their own side, which did not reach the other side.</p>

<p>”The following morning had removed the fires of the night, and the
Sun, with <ins class = "corr bell" title = "Bell translates ‘his’">its</ins> rays, had dried the grass <ins class = "corr mckay"

<span class = "linenum mckay">IV. 89-117</span>
conceal themselves beneath the shade of a tree. There was there a lofty
mulberry tree, very full of snow-white fruit, quite close to a cold
spring. The <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘arrangements’">arrangement</ins> suits them; and the light, seeming to
depart <i>but</i> slowly, is buried in the waters, and from the same
waters the night arises. The clever Thisbe, turning the hinge, gets out
in the dark, and deceives her <i>attendants</i>, and, having covered her
face, arrives at the tomb, and sits down under the tree agreed upon;
love made her bold. Lo! a&nbsp;lioness approaches, having her foaming
jaws besmeared with the recent slaughter of oxen, about to quench her
thirst with the water of the neighboring spring. The Babylonian
<span class = "pagenum bell">123</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">IV. 99-130</span>
Thisbe sees her at a distance, by the rays of the moon, and with a
trembling foot she flies to a dark cave; and, while she flies, her veil
falling from her back, she leaves it behind. When the savage lioness has
quenched her thirst with plenteous water, as she is returning into the
woods, she tears the thin covering, found by chance without Thisbe
herself, with her blood-stained mouth.</p>

<p>“Pyramus, going out later <i>than Thisbe</i>, saw the evident
footmarks of a wild beast, in the deep dust, and grew pale all over his
face. But, as soon as he found her veil, as well, dyed with blood, he
said: ‘One night will be the ruin of two lovers, of whom she was the
most deserving of a long life. My soul is guilty; ’tis I that have
destroyed thee, much to be lamented; who bade thee to come by night to
places full of terror, and came not hither first. O,&nbsp;whatever lions
are lurking beneath this rock, tear my body in pieces, and devour my
accursed entrails with ruthless jaws. But it is the part of a coward to
wish for death.’ He takes up the veil of Thisbe, and he takes it with
himself to the shade of the tree agreed on, and, after he has bestowed
tears on the well-known garment, he gives kisses <i>to the same</i>,
<span class = "pagenum mckay">141</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">IV. 118-141</span>
and he says, ‘Receive, now, a draught of my blood as well!’ and then
plunges the sword, with which he is girt, into his bowels; and without
delay, as he is dying, he draws it out of the warm wound. As he falls on
his back upon the ground, the blood spurts forth on high, not otherwise
than as when a pipe is burst on the lead decaying,<ins class = "corr
mckay" title = "footnote marker missing in McKay"><a class = "tag" name
= "tag4_22" id = "tag4_22" href = "#note4_22">22</a></ins> and shoots
out afar the liquid water from the hissing flaw, and cleaves the air
with its jet. The fruit of the tree, by the sprinkling of the blood, are
changed to a dark tint, and the root, soaked with the gore, tints the
hanging mulberries with a purple hue. Behold! not yet having banished
her fear, <i>Thisbe</i> returns, that she may not disappoint her lover,
and seeks for the youth both with her eyes and her affection, and longs
to tell him how great dangers
<span class = "pagenum bell">124</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">IV. 130-160</span>
she has escaped. And when she observes the spot, and the altered
appearance of the tree, she doubts if it is the same, so uncertain does
the color of the fruit make her. While she is in doubt, she sees
palpitating limbs throbbing upon the bloody ground; she draws back her
foot, and having her face paler than box-wood,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag4_23" id = "tag4_23" href = "#note4_23">23</a> she shudders like the
sea, which trembles<a class = "tag" name = "tag4_24" id = "tag4_24" href
= "#note4_24">24</a> when its surface is skimmed by a gentle breeze.
But, after pausing a time, she had recognized her own lover, she smote
her arms, undeserving <i>of such usage</i>, and tearing her hair, and
embracing the much-loved body, she filled the gashes with her tears, and
mingled her <i>tokens of</i> sorrow
<span class = "pagenum mckay">142</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">IV. 142-166</span>
with his blood; and imprinting kisses on his cold features, she
exclaimed, ‘Pyramus! what disaster has taken thee away from me? Pyramus!
answer me; ’tis thy own Thisbe, dearest, that calls thee; hear me, and
raise thy prostrate features.’</p>

<p>“At the name of Thisbe, Pyramus raised his eyes, now heavy with
death, and, after he had seen her, he closed them again. After she had
perceived her own garment, and beheld, too, the ivory <i>sheath</i><a

without its sword, she said, ‘’Tis thy own hand, and love, that has
destroyed thee, ill-fated <i>youth</i>! I,&nbsp;too, have a hand bold
<i>enough</i> for this one purpose; I&nbsp;have love as well; this shall
give me strength for the wound. I&nbsp;will follow thee in thy death,
and I shall be called the most <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘anhappy’">unhappy</ins> cause and companion of thy fate, and thou
who, alas! couldst be torn from me by death alone, shalt not be able,
even by death, to be torn from me. And you, O&nbsp;most wretched parents
of mine and his, be but prevailed upon, in this one thing, by the
entreaties of us both, that you will not deny those whom their constant
love <i>and</i> whom their last moments have joined, to be buried in the
same tomb. But thou, O&nbsp;tree, which now with thy boughs

cover <i>those</i> of two. Retain a token of <i>this our</i> fate, and
ever bear fruit black and suited for mourning, as a memorial of the
blood of us two.’ <i>Thus</i> she said; and having fixed the point under
the lower part of her breast, she fell upon the sword, which still was
reeking with his blood.</p>

<p>“Her prayers, however, moved the Gods, <i>and</i> moved their
parents. For the color of the fruit, when it has fully ripened, is

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
It is pretty clear, as we have already seen, that the establishment of
the worship of Bacchus in Greece met with great opposition, and that his
priests and devotees published several miracles and prodigies, the more
easily to influence the minds of their fellow-men. Thus, the daughters
of Minyas are said to have been changed into bats, solely because they
neglected to join in the orgies of that God; when, probably, the fact
was, that they were either secretly despatched, or were forced to fly
for their lives; and their absence was accounted for to the ignorant and
credulous, by the invention of this Fable. The story of Dercetis, as
related by Diodorus Siculus, Pliny, and Herodotus, is, that having
offended Venus, that Goddess caused her to fall in love with a young
man, by whom she had a daughter. In despair at her misfortune, she
killed her lover, and exposed her child, and afterwards drowned herself.
The Syrians, lamenting her fate, built a temple near where she was
drowned, and honored her as a Goddess. They stated that she was turned
into a fish, and they there represented her under the figure of a woman
down to the waist, and of a fish thence downwards. They also abstained
from eating fish; though they offered them to her in sacrifice, and
suspended gilded ones in her temple. Selden, in his Treatise on the
Syrian Gods, suggests that the story of Dercetis, or Atergatis, was
founded on the figure and worship of Dagon, the God of the Philistines,
who was represented under the figure of a fish; and that the name of
Atergatis is a corruption of ‘Adir Dagon,’ ‘a great fish,’ which is not
at all improbable. The same author supposes that Dercetis was originally
the same Deity with Venus, Astarte, Minerva, Juno, Isis, and the Moon;
and that she was worshipped under the name of Mylitta by the Assyrians,
and as Alilac by the Arabians. Lucian tells us, that Dercetis was
reported to have been the mother of Semiramis.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Ovid and Hyginus are the only authors that make mention of the story of
Pyramus and Thisbe, and both agree in making Babylon the scene of it. It
seems to be rather intended as a moral tale, than to have been built
upon any actual circumstance. It affords a lesson to youth not to enter
rashly
<span class = "pagenum bell">126</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">IV. 167-186</span>
into engagements: and to parents not to pursue, too rigorously, the
gratification of their own resentment, but rather to consult the
inclination of their children, when not likely to be productive of
unhappiness at a future period.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Plutarch, in his Treatise ‘How to read the Poets,’ suggests a curious
explanation of the discovery by the Sun of the intrigue of Mars and
Venus. He says that such persons as are born under the conjunction of
the planets Mars and Venus, are naturally of an amorous temperament; but
that if the Sun does not happen then to be at a distance, their
indiscretions will be very soon discovered.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Palæphatus gives a historical solution to the story. He says that
Helius, the son of Vulcan, king of Egypt, resolving to cause his
father’s laws against adultery to be strictly observed, and having been
informed that a lady of the court had an intrigue with one of the
courtiers, entered her apartment in the night, and obtaining ocular
proof of the courtier’s guilt, caused him to be severely punished. He
also tells us that the similarity of the name gave birth to the Fable
which Homer was the first to relate, with a small variation, and which
is here copied by Ovid. Libanius, deploring the burning of the Temple of
Apollo near Antioch, complains of the ingratitude of Vulcan to that God,
who had formerly discovered to him the infidelity of his wife;
a&nbsp;subject upon which St. Chrysostom seems to think that the
rhetorician would have done better to have been silent.</p>

to thee, by which thou mightst be able to put forth thy buried

more afflicting than that, since the lightnings that caused the death of
Phaëton. He, indeed, endeavors, if he can, to recall her cold limbs to
an enlivening heat, by the strength of his rays. But, since fate opposes
attempts so great, he sprinkles both her body and the place with
odoriferous nectar, and having first uttered many a complaint he says,
“Still shalt thou reach the skies.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag4_41" id

<p>But the author of light came no more to Clytie (although love might
have excused her grief, and her grief the betrayal); and he put an end
to his intercourse with her. From that time she, who had made so mad a
use of her passion, pined away, loathing the <i>other</i> Nymphs; and in
the open air, night and day, she sat on the bare ground, with her hair
dishevelled and unadorned. And for nine days, without water or food, she
subsisted in her fast, merely on dew and her own tears; and she did not
raise herself from the ground. She only used to look towards the face of
the God as he moved along, and to turn her own features towards him.

No ascertained historical fact can be found as the basis of the story of
Leucothoë being buried alive by her father Orchamus, or of her rival
<span class = "pagenum bell">131</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">IV. 271-284</span>
Clytie being metamorphosed into a sunflower. The story seems to have
been most probably simply founded on principles of natural philosophy.
Leucothoë, it is not unreasonable to suppose, may have been styled the
daughter of Orchamus, king of Persia, for no other reason but because
that Prince was the first to introduce the frankincense tree, which was
called Leucothoë, into his kingdom; and it was added that she fell in
love with Apollo, because the tree produces an aromatic drug much used
in physic, of which that God was fabled to have been the inventor. The
jealousy of Clytie was, perhaps, founded upon a fact, stated by some
naturalists, that the sunflower is a plant which kills the frankincense
tree, when growing near it. Pliny, however, who ascribes several
properties to the sunflower, does not mention this among them.</p>

Most probably, the story of the shepherd Daphnis being turned into a
stone, was no other than an allegorical method of expressing the
insensibility of an individual. Thalia was the name of the Nymph who was
thus affronted by Daphnis.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The story of Scython changing his sex, is perhaps based upon the fact,
that the country of Thrace, which took the name of Thracia from a famous
sorceress, was before called Scython; and that as it lost a name of the
masculine gender for one of the feminine, in after times it became
reported that Scython had changed sexes.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Pliny tells us that Celmus was a young man of remarkable wisdom and
moderation, and that the passions making no impression on him, he was
changed into adamant. Some, however, assert that he was foster-father to
Jupiter, by whom he was enclosed in an impenetrable tower, for revealing
the immortality of the Gods.</p>

<p class = "explanation">

married couple, who for their chaste and innocent life were said to have

<span class = "pagenum bell">133</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">IV. 295-326</span>
unknown spots, <i>and</i> to see unknown rivers, his curiosity lessening

"tag4_46" id = "tag4_46" href = "#note4_46">46</a> cities, and the
Carians, that border upon Lycia. Here he sees a pool of water, clear to
the <i>very</i> ground at the bottom; here there are no fenny reeds, no
barren sedge, no rushes with their sharp points. The water is
translucent; but the edges of the pool are enclosed with green turf, and
with grass ever verdant. A&nbsp;Nymph dwells <i>there</i>; but one
neither skilled in hunting, nor accustomed to bend the bow, nor to
contend in speed; the only one, too, of <i>all</i> the Naiads not known
to the swift Diana. The report is, that her sisters often said to her,
“Salmacis, do take either the javelin, or the painted quiver, and unite
thy leisure with the toils of the chase.” She takes neither the javelin,
nor the painted quiver, nor does she unite her leisure with the toils of
the chase. But sometimes she is bathing her beauteous limbs in her own
spring;
<span class = "pagenum mckay">152</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">IV. 311-333</span>
<i>and</i> often is she straitening her hair with a comb of Citorian
boxwood,<a class = "tag" name = "tag4_47" id = "tag4_47" href =
"#note4_47">47</a> and consulting the waters, into which she looks, what
is befitting her. At other times, covering her body with a transparent
garment, she reposes either on the soft leaves or on the soft grass.
Ofttimes is she gathering flowers. And then, too, by chance was she
gathering them when she beheld the youth, and wished to possess him,
<i>thus</i> seen.</p>

<p>But though she hastened to approach <i>the youth</i>, still she did
not approach him before she had put herself in order, and before she had
surveyed her garments, and put on her <i>best</i> looks, and deserved to
be thought beautiful. Then thus did she begin to speak: “O&nbsp;youth,
most worthy to be thought to be a God! if thou art a God, thou mayst
<i>well</i> be Cupid; but, if thou art a mortal, happy are they who
begot thee, and blessed is thy brother, and fortunate indeed thy sister,
if thou hast one, and the nurse <i>as well</i> who gave thee the breast.
But far, far more fortunate than all these <i>is she</i>; if thou hast
any wife, if thou shouldst vouchsafe any one <i>the honor of</i>
marriage.
<span class = "pagenum bell">134</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">IV. 326-349</span>
And if any one is thy <i>wife, then</i> let my pleasure be stolen; but,
if thou hast none, let me be <i>thy wife</i>, and let us unite in one
tie.” After these things <i>said</i>, the Naiad is silent; a&nbsp;blush
tinges the face of the youth: he knows not what love is, but even to
blush becomes him. Such is the color of apples, hanging on a tree
exposed to the sun, or of painted ivory, or of the moon blushing beneath
her brightness when the aiding <i>cymbals</i><a class = "tag" name =
"tag4_48" id = "tag4_48" href = "#note4_48">48</a> <i>of</i> brass are
resounding in
<span class = "pagenum mckay">153</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">IV. 334-349</span>
vain. Upon the Nymph desiring, without ceasing, such kisses at least as
he might give to his sister, and now laying her hands upon his neck,
white as ivory, he says, “Wilt thou desist, or am I to fly, and to leave
this place, together with thee?”</p>

<p>Salmacis is affrighted, and says, “I freely give up this spot to
thee, stranger,” and, with a retiring step, she pretends to go away. But
then looking back, and hid in a covert of shrubs, she lies concealed,
and puts her bended knees down to the ground. But he, just like a boy,
and as though unobserved on the retired sward, goes here and there, and
in the sportive waves dips the soles of his feet, and <i>then</i> his
feet as far as his ankles. Nor is there any delay; being charmed with
the temperature of the pleasant waters, he throws off his soft garments
from his tender body. Then, indeed, Salmacis is astonished, and burns
with desire for his naked beauty. The eyes, too, of the Nymph are on
fire, no otherwise than as when the Sun,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag4_49" id = "tag4_49" href = "#note4_49">49</a> most brilliant

<span class = "pagenum bell">135</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">IV. 349-371</span>
from the opposite image of a mirror. With difficulty does she endure
delay; hardly does she now defer her joy. Now she longs to embrace him;
and now, distracted, she can hardly contain herself. He, clapping his
body with his hollow palms, swiftly leaps into the stream, and throwing
out his arms alternately, shines in the limpid water, as if any one were
to cover statues of ivory, or white lilies, with clear glass.</p>

<p>“I have gained my point,” says the Naiad; “see, he is mine!” and, all
her garments thrown aside, she plunges in the midst of the waters, and
seizes him resisting her, and snatches reluctant kisses, and thrusts
down her hands, and touches his breast against his will, and clings
about the youth, now one way, and now another. Finally, as he is
struggling against her, and desiring to escape, she entwines herself
about him, like a serpent which the royal bird takes up and is bearing
aloft; and as it hangs, it holds fast his head and feet, and enfolds his
spreading wings with its tail. Or, as the ivy is wont to wind itself
along the tall trunks <i>of trees</i>; and as the polypus<a class =
"tag" name = "tag4_50" id = "tag4_50" href = "#note4_50">50</a> holds

"tag4_51" id = "tag4_51" href = "#note4_51">51</a> <i>still</i> persist,
and deny the Nymph the hoped-for joy. She presses him hard; and clinging
to him with every limb, as she holds fast, she says, “Struggle as thou
mayst, perverse one, still thou shalt not escape. So ordain it, ye Gods,
and let no time
<span class = "pagenum bell">136</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">IV. 371-390</span>
separate him from me, nor me from him.” Her prayers find propitious
Deities, for the mingled bodies of the two are united,<a class = "tag"
name = "tag4_52" id = "tag4_52" href = "#note4_52">52</a> and one human

So, when their bodies meet together in the firm embrace, they are no
more two, and their form is twofold, so that they can neither be styled
woman nor boy; they seem <i>to be</i> neither and both.</p>

<p>Therefore, when Hermaphroditus sees that the limpid waters, into
which he had descended as a man, have made him but half a male, and that
his limbs are softened in them, holding up his hands, he says, but now
no longer with the voice of a male, “O,&nbsp;both father and mother,
grant this favor to your son, who has the name of you both, that whoever
enters these streams a man, may go out thence <i>but</i> half a man, and

<p class = "explanation">
The only probable solution of this story seems to have been the fact
that there was in Caria, near the town of Halicarnassus, as we read in
Vitruvius, a&nbsp;fountain which was instrumental in civilizing certain
barbarians who had been driven from that neighborhood by the Argive
colony established there. These men being obliged to repair to the
fountain for water, and meeting the Greek colonists there, their
intercourse not only polished them, but in course of time corrupted
them, by the introduction of the luxurious manners of Greece. Hence the
fountain had the reputation of changing men into women.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Possibly the water of that fountain, by some peculiar chemical quality,
made those who drank of it become soft and effeminate, as waters are to
be occasionally found with extraordinary qualities. Lylius Gyraldus
suggests, that several disgraceful adventures happened near this
fountain (which was enclosed by walls), which in time gave it a bad
name.</p>

re-echo; myrrh and saffron shed their fragrant odors; and, a&nbsp;thing
past all belief, their webs begin to grow green, and the cloth hanging

<p>And now the day was past, and the time came on, which you could
neither call darkness nor light, but yet the <i>very</i> commencement of
the dubious night along with the light. The house seemed suddenly to
shake, and unctuous torches to burn, and the building to shine with
glowing fires, and the fictitious phantoms of savage wild beasts to
howl. Presently, the sisters are hiding themselves throughout the
smoking house, and in different places are avoiding the fires and the
light. While they are seeking a hiding-place, a&nbsp;membrane is
stretched over their small limbs, and covers their arms with light
wings; nor does the darkness suffer them to know by what means they have
lost their former shape. No feathers bear them up; yet they support
themselves on pellucid wings; and, endeavoring to speak, they utter a
voice very diminutive <i>even</i> in proportion to their bodies, and
express their low complaints with a squeaking sound. They frequent
houses, not woods; and, abhorring the light, they fly <i>abroad</i> by
night. And from the late evening do they derive their name.<a class =

<p>Juno, the daughter of Saturn, leaving her celestial habitation,
submits to go thither, so much does she give way to hatred and to anger.
Soon as she has entered there, and the threshold groans, pressed by her
sacred body, Cerberus raises his threefold mouth, and utters triple
barkings at the same moment. She summons the Sisters,<a class = "tag"
name = "tag4_57" id = "tag4_57" href = "#note4_57">57</a> begotten of
Night, terrible and implacable Goddesses. They are sitting before the
doors of the prison shut close with adamant, and are combing black
vipers from their hair. Soon as they recognize her amid the shades of
darkness, <i>these</i> Deities arise. This place is called “the
accursed.” Tityus<a class = "tag" name = "tag4_58" id = "tag4_58" href =

round, and both follows and flies from himself. The granddaughters, too,
of Belus, who dared to plot the destruction of their cousins, are
everlastingly taking up the water which they lose. After the daughter of
Saturn has beheld all these with a stern look, and Ixion before all;
again, after him, looking upon Sisyphus, she says,</p>

<p>“Why does he alone, of <i>all</i> the brothers, suffer eternal
punishment? and why does a rich palace contain the proud Athamas, who,
with his wife, has ever despised me?” And <i>then</i> she explains the
cause of her hatred and of her coming, and what it is she desires. What
she desires is, that the palace of Cadmus shall not stand, and that the
Sister <i>Furies</i> shall involve Athamas in crime. She mingles
together promises, commands, and entreaties, and solicits the Goddesses.
When Juno has thus spoken, Tisiphone, with her locks dishevelled as they
are, shakes them, and throws back from her face the snakes crawling over
it; and thus she says: “There is no need of a long preamble; whatever
thou commandest, consider it as done: leave these hateful realms, and
betake thyself to the air of a better heaven.”</p>

<p>Juno returns, overjoyed; and, preparing to enter heaven, Iris,<a

and puts on a cloak red with fluid blood, and is girt

<span class = "linenum mckay">IV. 482-511</span>
with twisted snakes, and <i>then</i> goes forth from her abode. Mourning
attends her as she goes, and Fright, and Terror, and Madness with
quivering features. She <i>now</i> reaches the threshold; the Æolian
door-posts are said to have shaken, and paleness tints the maple door;
the Sun, too, flies from the place. His wife is terrified at these
prodigies; Athamas, <i>too</i>, is alarmed, and they are <i>both</i>
preparing to leave the house. The baneful Erinnys stands in the way, and
blocks up the passage; and extending her arms twisted round with folds
of vipers, she shakes her locks; the snakes <i>thus</i> moved, emit a
sound. Some lying about her shoulders, some gliding around her temples,
send forth hissings and
<span class = "pagenum bell">141</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">IV. 496-523</span>
vomit forth corruption, and dart forth their tongues. Then she tears
away two snakes from the middle of her hair, which, with pestilential
hand, she throws against them. But these creep along the breasts of Ino
and Athamas, and inspire them with direful intent. Nor do they inflict
any wounds upon their limbs; it is the mind that feels the direful
stroke. She had brought, too, with her a monstrous composition of liquid
poison, the foam of the mouth of Cerberus, and the venom of Echidna;<a
class = "tag" name = "tag4_64" id = "tag4_64" href = "#note4_64">64</a>
and purposeless aberrations, and the forgetfulness of a darkened
understanding, and crime, and tears, and rage, and the love of murder.
All these were blended together; and, mingled with fresh blood she had
boiled them in a hollow vessel of brass, stirred about with <i>a stalk
of</i> green hemlock. And while they are trembling, she throws the
maddening poison into the breasts of them both, and moves their inmost
vitals. Then repeatedly waving her torch in the same circle, she swiftly
follows up the flames <i>thus</i> excited with <i>fresh</i> flames. Thus
triumphant, and having executed her commands, she returns to the empty
realms of the great Pluto; and she ungirds the snakes which she had put
on.

beast; and he snatches Learchus, smiling and stretching forth his little
arms from the bosom of his mother, and three or four times he whirls him
round in the air like a sling, and, frenzied, he dashes in pieces<a

thinking that there was no doubt of their death, they lamented the house
of Cadmus, with their hands tearing their hair and their garments; and
they threw the odium on the Goddess, as being unjust and too severe
against the concubine. Juno could not endure their reproaches, and said,
“I&nbsp;will make you yourselves tremendous memorials of my
displeasure.” Confirmation followed her words. For the one who had been
especially attached, said, “I&nbsp;will follow the queen into the sea;”
and about to give the leap, she could not be moved any way, and adhering
to the rock, <i>there</i> she stuck fast. Another, while she was
attempting to beat her breast with the accustomed blows, perceived in
the attempt that her arms had become stiff. One, as by chance she had
extended her

those same waters. You might see the fingers of another suddenly
hardened in her hair, as she was tearing her locks seized on the top of
her head. In whatever posture each was found <i>at the beginning of the
change</i>, in the same she remained. Some became birds; which, sprung
from Ismenus, skim along the surface of the waves in those seas, with

Athamas, the son of Æolus, and great-grandson of Deucalion, having, on
the death of Themisto, his first wife, married Ino, the daughter of
Cadmus, divorced her soon afterwards, to marry Nephele, by whom he had
Helle and <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘Phrysus’">Phryxus</ins>. She having been divorced in her turn, he took
Ino back again, and by her had Learchus and <ins class = "corr bell"
title = "Bell reads ‘Melacerta’">Melicerta</ins>. Ino, not being able to
endure the presence of the children of Nephele, endeavored to destroy
them. The city of Thebes being at that time afflicted with famine,
<span class = "pagenum bell">144</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">IV. 563-571</span>
which was said to have been caused by Ino, who ordered the seed to be
parched before it was sown, Athamas ordered the oracle of Delphi to be
consulted. The priests, either having been bribed, or the messengers
having been corrupted, word was brought, that, to remove this
affliction, the children of Nephele must be sacrificed.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Phryxus being warned of the designs of his stepmother, embarked in a
ship, with his sister Helle, and sailed for Colchis, where he met with a
kind reception from his kinsman Æetes. The young princess, however,
either becoming sea-sick, and leaning over the bulwarks of the vessel,
fell overboard and was drowned, or died a natural death in the passage
of the Hellespont, to which she gave its name from that circumstance.
Athamas, having discovered the deceitful conduct of Ino, in his rage
killed her son Learchus, and sought her, for the purpose of sacrificing
her to his vengeance. To avoid his fury, she fled with her son
Melicerta, and, being pursued, threw herself from a rock into the sea.
To console her relatives, the story was probably invented, that the Gods
had changed Ino and Melicerta into Sea Deities, under the names of
Leucothoë and Palæmon. Melicerta was afterwards worshipped in the Isle
of Tenedos, where children were offered to him in sacrifice. In his
honor, Glaucus established the Isthmian games, which were celebrated for
many ages at Corinth; and, being interrupted for a time, were revived by
Theseus, in honor of Neptune. Leucothoë was also worshipped at Rome, and
the Roman women used to offer up their vows to her for their brothers’
children, not daring to supplicate the Goddess for their own, because
she had been unfortunate in hers. This Ovid tells us in the Sixth Book
of the Fasti. The Romans gave the name of Matuta to Ino, and Melicerta,
or Palæmon, was called Portunus.</p>

and he falls flat on his breast, and his legs, joined into one, taper

makes a hissing: this is the voice that Nature leaves him. His wife,
smiting her naked breast with her hand, cries aloud, “Stay, Cadmus! and
deliver thyself, unhappy one, from this monstrous form. Cadmus, what
means this? Where are thy feet? where are both thy shoulders and thy

<p class = "explanation">
After Cadmus had reigned at Thebes many years, a&nbsp;conspiracy was
formed against him. Being driven from the throne, and his grandson
Pentheus assuming the crown, he and his wife Hermione retired into
Illyria, where, as Apollodorus says, he commanded the Illyrian army, and
at length was chosen king: on his death, the story here related by Ovid
was
<span class = "pagenum bell">146</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">IV. 604-608</span>
invented. It is possible that it may have been based on the following
grounds:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The Phœnicians were anciently called ‘Achivi,’ which name they still
retained after their establishment in Greece. ‘Chiva’ being also the
Hebrew, and perhaps Phœnician word for ‘a serpent,’ the Greeks, probably
in reference to the Phœnician origin of Cadmus, reported after his
death, that he and his wife were serpents; and in time, that
transformation may have been stated to have happened at the end of his
life. According to Aulus Gellius, the ancient inhabitants of Illyria had
two eyelids to each eye, and with their looks, when angered, they were
able to kill those whom they beheld <ins class = "corr both" title =
"spelling unchanged">stedfastly</ins>. The Greeks hence called them
serpents and basilisks; and, it is not unlikely, that when Cadmus
retired among them, they said that he had become one of the Illyrians,
otherwise a dragon, or a serpent. All the ancient writers who mention
his history agree that Cadmus really did retire into Illyria, where he
first assisted the Enchelians in their war against the Illyrians. The
latter were defeated, and, to obtain a peace from the Enchelians, they
gave the crown to Cadmus; to which, on his death, his son Illyrus
succeeded. The historian Christodorus, quoted by Pausanias,
<span class = "pagenum mckay">166</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">IV. 604-617</span>
says that he built the city of Nygnis, in the country of the
Enchelians.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Some writers have supposed, upon the authority of Euhemerus as quoted by
Eusebius that Cadmus was not the son of Agenor, but was one of his
officers, who eloped thence with Hermione, a&nbsp;singing girl. Others
suppose that Cadmus is not really a proper name, but that it signifies a
‘leader,’ or ‘conductor;’ and that he received the name from leading a
colony into Greece. <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘Bochard’; final ‘t’ invisible in Bell">Bochart</ins> says that he was
called Cadmus, because he came from the eastern part of Phœnicia, which
is called in Scripture ‘Cadmonia,’ or ‘oriental;’ and that Hermione
probably received her name from Mount Hermon.</p>

be the offspring of Jove. Neither did he think Perseus to be the
offspring of Jupiter, whom Danaë had conceived in a shower of gold; but
soon (so great is the power of truth) Acrisius was sorry, both that he
had insulted the God, and that he had not acknowledged his grandson. The
one was now placed in heaven, while the other, bearing the memorable
spoil of the viperous monster, cut the yielding air with hissing wings;
and while the conqueror was hovering over the

Libyan sands, bloody drops, from the Gorgon’s head, fell down, upon
receiving <i>which, the</i> ground quickened them into various serpents.
For this cause, that region is filled and infested with snakes.</p>

<p>Carried thence, by the fitful winds, through boundless space, he is
borne now here, now there, just like a watery cloud, and, from the lofty
sky, looks down upon the earth, removed afar; and he flies over the
whole world. Three times he saw the cold Bears, thrice did he see the
claws of the Crab; ofttimes he was borne to the West, many a time to the
East. And now, the day declining, afraid to trust himself to the night,
he stopped in the Western part of the world, in the kingdom of Atlas;
and <i>there</i> he sought a little rest, until Lucifer should usher
forth the fires of Aurora, Aurora, the chariot of the day. Here was
Atlas, the son of Iapetus, surpassing all men in the vastness of his
body. Under this king was the extremity of the earth, and the sea which
holds its waters under the panting horses of the Sun, and receives the
wearied chariot. For him, a&nbsp;thousand flocks, and as many herds,
wandered over the pastures, and no neighboring places disturbed the
land. Leaves of the trees, shining with radiant gold, covered branches
of gold, <i>and</i> apples of gold. “My friend,” said Perseus to him,
“if the glory of a noble race influences thee, Jupiter is the author of
my descent; or if thou art an admirer of exploits, thou wilt admire
mine. I&nbsp;beg of thee hospitality, and a resting place.” The other
was mindful of an ancient oracle. The Parnassian Themis had given this
response: “A&nbsp;time will come,
<span class = "pagenum bell">148</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">IV. 644-662</span>
Atlas, when thy tree shall be stripped of its gold, and a son of Jove
shall have the honor of the prize.” Dreading this, Atlas had enclosed
his orchard with solid walls, and had given it to be kept by a huge
dragon;<a class = "tag" name = "tag4_76" id = "tag4_76" href =
"#note4_76">76</a> and expelled all strangers from his territories.
<i>To Perseus</i>, too, he says, “Far hence begone, lest the glory of
the exploits, to which thou falsely pretendest, and Jupiter as well, be
far from protecting thee.” He adds violence as well to his threats, and
tries to drive him from his doors, as he hesitates and mingles resolute
words with
<span class = "pagenum mckay">168</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">IV. 653-662</span>
persuasive ones. Inferior in strength (for who could be a match for
Atlas in strength?), he says “Since my friendship is of so little value
to thee, accept <i>this</i> present;” and then, turning his face away,
he exposes on the left side the horrible features of Medusa. Atlas,
great as he is, becomes a mountain. Now his beard and his hair are
changed into woods; his shoulders and his hands become mountain ridges,
and what was formerly his head, is the summit on the top of the
mountain. His bones become stones; then, enlarged on every side, he
grows to an immense height (so you willed it, ye Gods), and the whole
heaven, with so many stars, rests upon him.</p>

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
The story of the seduction of Danaë, the mother of Perseus, by Jupiter,
in the form of a shower of gold, has been thus explained by some of the
ancient writers. Acrisius, hearing of a prediction that Danaë, his
daughter, should bring forth a child that would kill him, caused her to
be shut in a tower with brazen gates, or, according to some, in a
subterraneous chamber, covered with plates of that metal; which place,
according to Pausanias, remained till the time of Perilaus, the king of
Argos, by whom it was destroyed. The precautions of Acrisius were,
however, made unavailing by his brother Prœtus; who, falling in love
with his niece, corrupted the guards with gold, and gained admission
into the tower. Danaë, being delivered of Perseus, her father caused
them to be exposed in a boat to the mercy of the waves. Being cast on
shore near Seriphus, the king, Polydectes, gave them a hospitable
reception, and took care of the education of Perseus.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Diodorus Siculus says that the Gorgons were female warriors, who
inhabited the neighborhood of Lake Tritonis, in Libya. Pausanias
explains the story of Medusa, by saying that she ruled the people in
that neighborhood, and laid waste the lands of the nations in her
vicinity. Perseus, having fled, with some companions, from Peloponnesus,
surprised her by night, and killed her, together with her escort. The
next morning, the beauty of her face appeared so remarkable that he cut
it off, and afterwards
<span class = "pagenum bell">149</span>
took it with him to Greece, to show it to the people, who could not look
on it without being struck with astonishment. On this explanation we may
remark, that if it is true, Perseus must have had more skill than the
surgeons of our day, in being able to preserve the beauty of the
features so long after death.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Again, many of the ancient historians, with Pliny, Athenæus, and
Solinus, think that the Gorgons were wild women of a savage nature,
living in caves and forests, who, falling on wayfarers, committed
dreadful atrocities. Palæphatus and Fulgentius think that the Gorgons
really were three young women, possessed of great wealth, which they
employed in a very careful manner; Phorcus,
<span class = "pagenum mckay">169</span>
their father, having left them three islands, and a golden statue of
Minerva, which they placed in their common treasury. They had one
minister in common for the management of their affairs, who used to go
for that purpose from one island to another, whence arose the story that
they had but one eye, and that they lent it to one another alternately.
Perseus, a&nbsp;fugitive from Argos, hearing of the golden statue,
determined to obtain it; and with that view, seized their minister, or,
in the allegorical language of the poets, took their eye away from them.
He then sent them word, that if they would give him the statue, he would
deliver up his captive, and threatened, in case of refusal, to put him
to death. Stheno and Euryale consented to this; but Medusa resisting,
she was killed by Perseus. Upon his obtaining the statue, which was
called the Gorgon, or Gorgonian, he broke it in pieces, and placed the
head on the prow of his ship. As the sight of this, and the fame of the
exploits of Perseus, spread terror everywhere, and caused passive
submission to him, the fable originated, that with Medusa’s head he
turned his enemies into stone. Landing in the Isle of Seriphus, the king
fled, with all his subjects; and, on entering the chief city, finding
nothing but the bare stones there, he caused the report to be spread,
that he had petrified the inhabitants.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Servius, in his Commentary on the Æneid, quotes an opinion of Ammonius
Serenus, that the Gorgons were young women of such beauty as to make a
great impression on all that saw them; for which reason they were said
to turn them into statues. Le&nbsp;Clerc thinks that the story bears
reference to a voyage which the Phœnicians had made in ancient times to
the coast of Africa, whence they brought a great number of horses; and
that the name ‘Perseus’ comes from the Phœnician word ‘pharscha,’ ‘a
horseman;’ while the horse Pegasus was so called from the Phœnician
‘pagsous,’ ‘a bridled horse,’ according to the conjecture of Bochart.
Alexander of Myndus, a&nbsp;historian quoted by Athenæus, says that
Libya had an animal which the natives called ‘gorgon;’ that it resembled
a sheep, and with its breath killed all those who approached it; that a
tuft of hair fell over its eyes, which was so heavy as to be removed
with difficulty, for the purpose of seeing the objects around it; but
that when it was removed, by its looks it struck dead any person whom it
gazed upon. He says, that in the war with Jugurtha, some of the soldiers
of Marius were thus slain by it, and that it was at last killed by means
of arrows discharged from a great distance.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The Gorgons are said to have inhabited the Gorgades, islands in the
<span class = "pagenum bell">150</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">IV. 663-670</span>
Æthiopian Sea, the chief of which was called Cerna, according to
Diodorus and Palæphatus. It is not improbable that the Cape Verde
Islands were called by this name. The fable of the transformation of
Atlas into the mountain of that name may possibly have been based upon
the simple fact, that Perseus killed him in the neighborhood of that
range, from which circumstance it derived the name which it has borne
ever since. The golden apples, which Atlas guarded with so much care,
were probably either gold mines, which Atlas had discovered in the
mountains of his country, and had secured with armed men and watchful
dogs; or sheep, whose fleeces were extremely valuable for their
fineness; or else oranges and lemons, and other fruits peculiar to very
hot climates,

space of air, which a Balearic string can pass with the whirled plummet
of lead; when suddenly the youth, spurning the earth with his feet, rose
on high into the clouds. As the shadow of the hero was seen on the

some weeds produced beneath the sea, and lays upon them the face of
Medusa, the daughter of Phorcys. The fresh weeds, being still alive,
imbibed the poison of the monster in their spongy pith, and hardened by
its touch; and felt an unwonted stiffness in their branches and their
leaves. But the Nymphs of the sea attempt the wondrous feat on many

have done the feast, and have cheered their minds with the gifts of the

I&nbsp;beseech thee, with how great valor and by what arts thou didst
cut off the head all hairy with serpents.” The descendant of Abas tells
them that there is a spot situate beneath cold Atlas, safe in its
bulwark of a solid mass; that, in the entrance of this, dwelt the two
sisters, the daughters of Phorcys, who shared the use of a single eye;
that he stealthily, by sly craft, while it was being handed over,<a

their craggy sides, he had arrived at the abodes of the Gorgons, and saw

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
It is extremely difficult to surmise what may have given rise to many of
the fabulous circumstances here narrated. It has been conjectured by
some, that Pegasus and his brother Chrysaor, the two horses produced
from the blood of Medusa, were really two ships in the harbor of the
island where that princess was residing at the time when she was slain
by Perseus; and that, on that event, they were seized by him. Perhaps
they had the figure of a winged horse on the prow; from which
circumstance the fable had its origin. Possibly, the story of the
production of coral from the blood of Medusa may have originated in the
fact, that on the defeat of the Gorgons, navigation became more safe,
and, consequently, the fishing for coral more common that it had been
before.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The story of the exposure of Andromeda may be founded on the fact, that
she was contracted by her parents against her will to some fierce,
piratical prince, who infested the adjacent seas with his depredations;
and that the betrothal was made, on condition that he should
<span class = "pagenum bell">156</span>
allow the realms of her father, Cepheus, to be free and undisturbed;
Perseus, being informed of this, slew the pirate, and Phineus having
been kept in a state of inactivity through dread of the valor of
Perseus, it was fabled that he had been changed into a stone. This
interpretation of the story is the one suggested by Vossius.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Some writers think, that Phineus, the uncle of Andromeda, was the enemy
from which she was rescued by Perseus, and who is here represented under
the form of a monster; while others suggest that this monster was the
name of the ship in which the pirate before mentioned was to have
carried away Andromeda.</p>

were also used for carrying fruits and flowers. Virgil (Ecl. v. l. 71)
speaks of cups for holding wine, under the name of ‘Calathi.’</p>

<i>Unseasonable labor.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 32. ‘Minerva;’ the name of the
Goddess Minerva is here used for the exercise of the art of spinning, of
which she was the patroness. The term ‘intempestiva’ is appropriately
applied, as the arts of industry and frugality, which were first
invented by Minerva, but ill accorded with the idle and vicious mode of
celebrating the festival of Bacchus.</p>

<i>Dercetis.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 45. Lucian, speaking of Dercetis, or
Derceto, says, ‘I have seen in Phœnicia a statue of this goddess, of a
very singular kind. From the middle upwards, it represents a woman, but
below it terminates in a fish. The statue of her, which is shown at
Hieropolis, represents her wholly as a woman.’ He further says, that the
temple of this last city was thought by some to have been built by
Semiramis, who consecrated it not to Juno, as is generally believed, but
to her own mother, Derceto. Atergatis was another name of this Goddess.
She was said, by an illicit amour, to have been the mother of Semiramis,
and in despair, to have thrown herself into a lake near Ascalon, on
which she was changed into a fish.</p>

to have been a Nymph of the Island of the Sun, called also Nosola,
between Taprobana (the modern Ceylon) and the coast of Carmania (perhaps
Coromandel), who was in the habit of changing such youths as fell into
her hands into fishes. As a reward for her cruelty, she herself was
changed into a fish by the Sun.</p>

<i>The tomb of Ninus.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 88. According to Diodorus Siculus,
the sepulchre of Ninus, the first king of Babylon, was ten stadia in
length, and nine in depth; it had the appearance of a vast citadel, and
was at a considerable distance from the city of Babylon. Commentators
have expressed some surprise that Ovid here uses the word ‘busta,’ for
‘tomb,’ as the place of meeting for these chaste lovers, as the
prostitutes of Rome used to haunt the ‘busta,’ or ‘tombs;’ whence they
obtained the epithet of ‘bustuariæ.’</p>

<i>The lead decaying.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 122. ‘Fistula’ here means ‘a
water-pipe.’ Vitruvius speaks of three methods of conveying water; by
channels of masonry, earthen pipes, and leaden pipes. The latter were
smaller, and more generally used; to them reference is here made. They
were formed by bending plates of lead into a form, not cylindrical, but
the section of which was oblong, and tapering towards the top like a
pear. The description here given, though somewhat homely, is extremely
natural, and, as frequent experience shows us, depicts the results when
the soldering of a water-pipe has become decayed.</p>

<i>The ivory sheath.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 148. The ‘vagina,’ or ‘sheath’ of
the sword, was often highly decorated; and we learn from Homer and
Virgil, as well as Ovid, that ivory was much used for that purpose. The
sheath was worn by the Greeks and Romans on the left side of the body,
so as to enable them to draw the sword from it, by passing the right
hand in front of the body, to take hold of the hilt, with the thumb next
to the blade.</p>

<i>The folding doors.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 185. The plural word ‘valvæ’ is
often used to signify a door, or entrance, because among the ancients
each doorway generally contained two doors folding together. The
internal doors even of private houses were bivalve; hence, as in the
present case, we often read of the folding doors of a bed-chamber. Each
of these doors or valves was usually wide enough to permit persons to
pass each other in egress and ingress without opening the other door as
well. Sometimes each valve was double, folding like our
window-shutters.</p>

plant which is called the sunflower. The small aromatic flower which we
call heliotrope, with its violet hue and delightful perfume, more nearly
answers the description. The larger flower probably derived its name
from the resemblance which it bears to the sun, surrounded with rays, as
depicted by the ancient painters.</p>

<i>The Curetes.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 282. According to Dionysius of
Halicarnassus, the Curetes were the ancient inhabitants of Crete. We may
here remark, that the story of their springing from the earth after a
shower of rain, seems to have no other foundation than the fact of their
having been of the race of the Titans; that is, they were descended from
Uranus, or Cœlus and Tita, by which names were meant the heaven and the
earth.</p>

<i>Citorian boxwood.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 311. Citorus, or Cythorus, was a
mountain of Paphlagonia, famous for the excellence of the wood of the
box trees that grow there. The Greeks and Romans made their combs of it.
The Egyptians used them made of ivory and wood, and toothed on one side
only; those of the Greeks had teeth on both sides. Great care was
usually taken of the hair; to go with it uncombed was a sign of
affliction.</p>

<i>The aiding cymbals.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 333. The witches and magicians,
in ancient times, and especially those of Thessaly, professed to be
able, with their charms and incantations, to bring the moon down from
heaven. The truth of these assertions being commonly believed, at the
period of an eclipse it was supposed by the multitude that the moon was
being subjected to the spells of these magicians, and that she was
struggling (<ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘laborat’">laborabat</ins>) against them, on which the sound of drums,
trumpets, and cymbals was resorted to, to distract the attention of the
moon, and to drown the charms repeated by the enchanters, for which
reason, the instruments employed for the purpose were styled ‘<ins class

<a name = "note4_49" id = "note4_49" href = "#tag4_49">49.</a>
<i>As when the Sun.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 349. Bailey gives this explanation
of the passage,&mdash; ‘The eyes of the Nymph seemed to sparkle and
shine, just as the rays of the sun in a clear sky when a looking-glass
is placed against them, for then they seem most splendid, and contract
the fire.’ From the mention of the eyes of the Nymph burning ‘flagrant,’
we might be almost justified in concluding that ‘speculum’ means here
not a mirror, but a burning-glass. The ‘specula,’ or looking-glasses, of
the ancients were usually made of metal, either a composition of tin and
copper, or silver; but in later times, alloy was mixed with the silver.
Pliny mentions the obsidian stone, or, as it is now called, the
Icelandic agate, as being used for this purpose. Nero is said to have
used emeralds for mirrors. Pliny the Elder says that mirrors were made
in the glass-houses of Sidon, which consisted of glass plates, with
leaves of metal at the back; they were probably of an inferior
character. Those of copper and tin were made chiefly at Brundisium. The
white metal formed from this mixture soon becoming dim, a&nbsp;sponge
with powdered pumice stone was usually fastened to the mirrors made of
that composition. They were generally small, of a round or oval shape,
and having a handle; and female slaves usually held them, while their
mistresses were performing the duties of the toilet. Sometimes they were
fastened to the walls, and they were occasionally of the length of a
person’s body. Venus was supposed often to use the mirror; but Minerva
repudiated the use of it.</p>

On account of his enormous size, the poets sometimes style him a son of
the earth. Attempting to commit violence upon Latona, he was slain by
the arrows of Apollo, and precipitated to the infernal regions, where he

Nymph Plote. The crime for which he was punished is differently related
by the poets. Some say, that he divulged the secrets of the Gods, that
had been entrusted to him; while others relate, that at an entertainment
which he gave to the Deities, he caused his own son, Pelops, to be
served up, on which Ceres inadvertently ate his shoulder. He was doomed
to suffer intense hunger and thirst, amid provisions of all kinds within
his reach, which perpetually receded from him.</p>

<i>Boundless Ionian sea.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 535. The Ionian sea must be
merely mentioned here as a general name for the broad expanse of waters,
of which the Saronic gulf, into which the Molarian rock projected,
formed part. Ovid may, however, mean to say that Ino threw herself from
some rock in the Ionian sea, and not from the Molarian rock; following,
probably, the account of some other writer, whose works are lost.</p>

temple in the deserts of Libya, where he was worshipped under the shape
of a ram; a&nbsp;form which he was supposed to have assumed, when, in
common with the other Deities, he fled from the attacks of the Giants.
The oracle of Jupiter Ammon being consulted relative to the sea monster,
which Neptune, at the request of the Nereids, had sent against the
Ethiopians, answered that Andromeda must be exposed to be devoured by
it; which Ovid here, not without reason, calls an unjust demand.</p>

Perseus is said to have received from Minerva, and by virtue of it he
was enabled to see without being seen. Lucian says that Minerva herself
held this reflecting shield before him, and by that means afforded him
the opportunity of seeing the reflection of Medusa’s figure; and that
Perseus, seizing her by the hair with his left hand, and keeping his eye
fixed on the image reflected in the shield, took his sword in his right,
and cut off her head, and then, by the aid of his wings, flew away
before the other Gorgon sisters were aware of what he had done.</p>

the sisters of Medusa, who were fabled to have wings, and claws of iron
on their hands. Ovid deals a sly hit in the words ‘non falsa pericula
cursus,’ at the tales of travellers, who, even in his day, seem to have
commenced dealing in the marvellous; as, indeed, we may learn for
ourselves, on turning to the pages of Herodotus, who seems to have been

<span class = "smallcaps">While</span> Perseus is continuing the
relation of the adventures of Medusa, Phineus, to whom Andromeda has
been previously promised in marriage, rushes into the palace, with his
adherents, and attacks his rival. A&nbsp;furious combat is the
consequence, in which Perseus gives signal proofs of his valor. At
length, perceiving himself likely to be overpowered by the number of his
enemies, he shows them the head of the Gorgon; on which Phineus and his
followers are turned into statues of stone. After this victory, he takes
Andromeda with him to Argos, his native city, where he turns the usurper
Prœtus into stone, and re-establishes his grandfather Acrisius on the
throne.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">And</span> while the hero, the son of
Danaë, is relating these things in the midst of the company of the
subjects of Cepheus, the royal courts are filled with a raging
multitude; nor is the clamor such as celebrates a marriage-feast, but
one which portends dreadful warfare. You might compare the banquet,
changed into a sudden tumult, to the sea, which, when calm, the
boisterous rage of the winds disturbs by raising its waves.</p>

<p>Foremost among these, Phineus,<a class = "tag" name = "tag5_1" id =
"tag5_1" href = "#note5_1">1</a> the rash projector of the onslaught,
shaking an ashen spear with a brazen point, cries, “Behold! <i>now</i>,

neither shall thy wings nor Jupiter turned into fictitious gold, deliver
thee from me.” As he is endeavoring to hurl <i>his lance</i>, Cepheus
cries out, “What art thou doing? What fancy, my brother, impels thee, in
thy madness, to this crime? Is this the due acknowledgment to return
<span class = "pagenum mckay">178</span>

for deserts so great? Dost thou repay the life of her <i>thus</i>

truth, that took her away from thee; but the incensed

majesty of the Nereids, and horned Ammon, and the monster of the sea,
which came to be glutted with my bowels. She was snatched from thee at
that moment, at which she was to have perished; unless it is that thou
dost, in thy cruelty, insist upon that very thing, that she should
perish, and wilt be appeased only by my affliction. It is not enough,
forsooth, that in thy presence she was bound and that <ins class = "corr
mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘though,’">thou,</ins> both her uncle and
her betrothed, didst give no assistance; wilt thou be grieving, besides,
that she was saved by another, and wilt thou deprive him of his reward?
If this appears great to thee, thou shouldst have recovered it from the
rock to which it was fastened. Now, let him who has recovered it,
through whom my old age is not childless, have what he stipulated for,
both by <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘its’">his</ins>
merits and his words; and know that he was preferred not before thee,
but before certain death.”</p>

<p><i>Phineus said</i> nothing, on the other hand; but viewing both him
and Perseus, with alternate looks, he was uncertain whether he should
<i>first</i> attack the one or the other; and, having paused a short
time, he vainly threw his spear, hurled with all the force that rage
afforded. As it stood fixed in the cushion,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag5_2" id = "tag5_2" href = "#note5_2">2</a> then, at length, Perseus
leapt off from the couch, and in his rage would have pierced the breast
of his enemy with the weapon, thrown back, had not Phineus gone behind
an altar, and <i>thus</i> (how unworthily!) an altar<a class = "tag"
name = "tag5_3" id = "tag5_3" href = "#note5_3">3</a> protected a
miscreant. However, the spear, not thrown in vain, stuck in the forehead
of Rhœtus; who, after he fell, and the steel was wrenched from the
skull, he
<span class = "pagenum mckay">179</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">V. 40-68</span>
<i>still</i> struggled, and besprinkled the laid tables with his blood.
But then does the multitude burst forth into ungovernable rage, and hurl
their weapons. Some there are, who say that Cepheus ought to die with
his son-in-law; but Cepheus has gone out by the entrance of the house,
calling right and good faith to witness, and the Gods of hospitality,<a

this disturbance is

made contrary to his will. The warlike Pallas comes; and with her shield
protects her brother <i>Perseus</i>, and gives him courage. There was an
Indian, Athis <i>by name</i>,<a class = "tag" name = "tag5_5" id =
"tag5_5" href = "#note5_5">5</a> whom Limnate, the daughter of the river
Ganges, is believed to have brought forth beneath the glassy waters;
excelling in beauty, which he improved by his rich dress; in his prime,
as yet but twice eight years of age, dressed in a purple tunic, which a
golden fringe bordered; a&nbsp;gilded necklace graced his neck, and a
curved hair-pin his hair wet with myrrh. He, indeed, had been taught to
hit things, although at a distance, with his hurled javelin, but <i>he
was</i> more skilled at bending the bow. <i>Perseus</i> struck him even
then, as he was bending with his hands the flexible horns <i>of a
bow</i>, with a billet, which, placed in the middle of the altar, was
smoking, and he crushed his face into his broken skull.</p>

<p>When the Assyrian Lycabas, who was a most attached friend of his, and
no concealer of his real affection, saw him rolling his features, the
objects of such praises, in his blood; after he had bewailed Athis,
breathing forth his life from this cruel wound, he seized the bow which
he had bent, and said, “And <i>now</i> let the contest against thee be
with me; not long shalt thou exult in the fate of the youth, by which
thou acquirest more hatred than praise.” All this he had not yet said,
<i>when</i> the piercing weapon darted from the string, and
<i>though</i> avoided, still it hung in the folds of his garment. The
grandson of Acrisius turned against

thrust it into his breast. But he, now dying, with his eyes swimming in
black night, looked around for Athis, and sank upon him, and carried to
the shades the consolation of a united death. Lo! Phorbas of Syene,<a

<span class = "linenum bell">V. 77-107</span>
arose the sword met them, being thrust in the ribs of the one,
<i>and</i> in the throat of Phorbas. But Perseus does not attack
Erithus, the son of Actor, whose weapon is a broad battle-axe, by using
his sword, but he takes up, with both hands, a&nbsp;huge bowl,<a class =
"tag" name = "tag5_8" id = "tag5_8" href = "#note5_8">8</a> standing out
with figures deeply embossed, and of vast mass in its weight, and hurls
it against the man. The other vomits forth red blood, and, falling on
his back, beats the ground with his dying head. Then he slays Polydæmon,
sprung from the blood of Semiramis, and the Caucasian Abaris, and
Lycetus, the son of Sperchius,<a class = "tag" name = "tag5_9" id =

Phlegias, and Clytus; and he tramples upon the heaps of the dying, which

declined the warfare<a class = "tag" name = "tag5_10" id = "tag5_10"

looking at the cruel Phineus with stern eyes, says, “Since I am

Hypseus kills Protenor, <i>and</i> Lyncides Hypseus. There is, too,

the Gods; as his years prevent him from fighting, he engages by talking,
and he condemns and utters imprecations against their accursed arms. As
he clings to the altars<a class = "tag" name = "tag5_11" id = "tag5_11"

head with his sword, which straightway falls upon the altar, and there,

his soul in the midst of the fires. Upon this, two brothers, Broteas and

unwarlike plectrum, Pettalus says, laughing, “Go sing the rest to the

<p>More work still remains, than what is <i>already</i> done; for it is
the intention of all to overwhelm one. The conspiring troops fight on
all sides, for a cause that
<span class = "pagenum mckay">183</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">V. 151-176</span>
attacks both merit and good faith. The one side, the father-in-law,
attached in vain, and the new-made wife, together with her mother,
encourage; and <i>these</i> fill the halls with their shrieks. But the
din of arms, and the groans of those that fall, prevail; and for once,
Bellona<a class = "tag" name = "tag5_18" id = "tag5_18" href =

plenteous blood, and is kindling the combat anew. Phineus, and a
thousand that follow Phineus, surround Perseus <i>alone</i>; darts are
flying thicker than the hail of winter, on both his sides, past his
eyes, and past his ears. On this, he places his shoulders against the
stone of a large pillar, and, having his back secure, and facing the
adverse throng, he withstands their attack. Chaonian<a class = "tag"

presses on the left, Nabathæan Ethemon on the right. As a tiger, urged
on by hunger, when it hears the lowings of two herds, in different
valleys, knows not on which side in preference to rush out, and
<i>yet</i> is eager to rush out on both; so Perseus, being in doubt
whether to bear onward to the right
<span class = "pagenum bell">163</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">V. 167-203</span>
or to the left, repulses Molpeus by a wound in the leg, which he runs
through, and is contented with his flight. Nor, indeed, does Ethemon
give him time, but fiercely attacks him; and, desirous to inflict a
wound deep in his neck, he breaks his sword, wielded with incautious
force; and against the extremity of a column which he has struck, the
blade flies to pieces, and sticks in the throat of its owner; yet that
blow has not power sufficient to <i>effect</i> his death. Perseus stabs
him with his Cyllenian<a class = "tag" name = "tag5_20" id = "tag5_20"
href = "#note5_20">20</a> falchion, trembling, and vainly extending his
unarmed hands.</p>

<p>But when Perseus saw his valor <i>likely</i> to yield to such
<span class = "pagenum mckay">184</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">V. 177-209</span>
numbers, he said, “Since you yourselves force me to do it, I&nbsp;will
seek assistance from an enemy: turn away your faces, if any of my
friends are here;” and <i>then</i> he produced the head of the Gorgon.
“<i>Go</i>, seek some one else,” said Thescelus, “for thy miracles to
affect;” and, as he was preparing to hurl his deadly javelin with his
hand, he stood fast in that posture, a&nbsp;statue of marble. Ampyx,
being next him, made a pass with his sword at the breast of Lyncidas,
full of daring spirit, and, while making it, his right hand became
stiff, moving neither to one side nor the other. But Nileus, who had
falsely boasted that he was begotten by the seven-mouthed Nile, and who
had engraved on his shield its seven channels, partly in silver, partly
in gold, said, “Behold, Perseus, the origin of my race; thou shalt carry
to the silent shades a great consolation for thy death, that thou wast
killed by one so great.” The last part of his address was suppressed in
the midst of the utterance; and you would think his half-open mouth was
attempting to speak, but it gave no passage for his words. Eryx rebuked
them,<a class = "tag" name = "tag5_21" id = "tag5_21" href =
"#note5_21">21</a> and said, “Ye are benumbed by the cowardice of your
minds, not by the locks of the Gorgon; rush on with me, and strike to
the ground <i>this</i> youth that wields his magic arms.” He was about
to rush on, <i>when</i> the earth arrested his steps, and he remained an
immovable stone, and an armed statue. But all these met with the
punishment they had deserved: there was one man, however, Aconteus <i>by
name</i>, a&nbsp;soldier of Perseus, for whom while he was fighting, on
beholding the Gorgon, he grew hard with stone rising upon him. Astyages,
<span class = "pagenum bell">164</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">V. 203-239</span>
thinking him still alive, struck him with his long sword; the sword
resounded with a shrill ringing. While Astyages was in amazement, he
took on himself the same nature: and the look of one in surprise
remained on his marble features. It is a tedious task to recount the
names of the men of the lower rank. Two hundred bodies were <i>yet</i>
remaining for the fight: two hundred bodies, on beholding the Gorgon,
grew stiff.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum mckay">185</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">V. 210-240</span>
Now at length Phineus repents of this unjust warfare. But what can he
do? He sees statues varying in form, and he recognizes his friends, and
demands help of them each, called by name; and not <i>yet</i> persuaded,
he touches the bodies next him; they are marble. He turns away <i>his
eyes</i>; and thus suppliant, and stretching forth his hands, that
confessed <i>his fault</i>, and his arms obliquely extended, he says,
“Perseus, thou hast conquered; remove the direful monster, and take away
that stone-making face of thy Medusa, whatever she may be; take it away,
I&nbsp;pray. It is not hatred, or the desire of a kingdom, that has
urged me to war: for a wife I wielded arms. Thy cause was the better in
point of merit, mine in point of time. I&nbsp;am not sorry to yield.
Grant me nothing, most valiant man, beyond this life; the rest be
thine.” Upon his saying such things, and not daring to look upon him,
whom he is entreating with his voice, <i>Perseus</i> says, “What am I
able to give thee, most cowardly Phineus, and, a&nbsp;great boon to a
craven, that will I give; lay aside thy fears; thou shalt be hurt by no
weapon. Moreover, I&nbsp;will give thee a monument to last forever, and
in the house of my father-in-law thou shalt always be seen, that my wife
may comfort herself with the form of her betrothed.” <i>Thus</i> he
said, and he turned the daughter of Phorcys to that side, towards which
Phineus had turned himself with trembling face. Then, even as he
endeavored to turn away his eyes, his neck grew stiff, and the moisture
of his eyes hardened in stone. But yet his timid features, and his
suppliant countenance, and his hands hanging down, and his guilty
attitude, still remained.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The scene of this story is supposed by some to have been in Æthiopia,
but it is more probably on the coast of Africa. Josephus and Strabo
assert that this event happened near the city of Joppa, or Jaffa:
indeed, Josephus says that the marks of the chains with which Andromeda
was fastened, were remaining on the rock in his time. Pomponius Mela
says, that Cepheus, the father of Andromeda, was king of Joppa, and that
the memory of that prince and of his brother Phineus was honored there
with religious services. He says, too, that the inhabitants used to show
the bones of the monster which was to have devoured Andromeda. Pliny
tells us the same, and that Scaurus carried these bones with him to
Rome. He calls the monster ‘a Goddess,’ ‘Dea Cete.’ Vossius believes
that he means the God Dagon, worshipped among the Syrians under the
figure of a fish, or sea-monster. Some authors have suggested that the
story of the creature which was to have devoured Andromeda, was a
confused version of that of the prophet Jonah.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The alleged power of Perseus, to turn his enemies into stone, was
probably, a&nbsp;metaphorical mode of describing his heroism, and the
terror which everywhere followed the fame of his victory over the
Gorgons. This probably caused such consternation, that it was reported
that he petrified his enemies by showing them the head of Medusa.
Bochart supposes that the rocky nature of the island of Seriphus, where
Polydectes reigned, was the ground of the various stories of the alleged
metamorphoses into stone, effected by means of the Gorgon’s head.</p>

the black clouds were flying from the cleared sky. It was our wish to
depart. Pyreneus closed his house, and prepared for violence, which we
escaped by taking wing. He himself stood aloft on the top <i>of his

speak so distinctly made that noise, and thought that a human being had
spoken. They were birds; and magpies that imitate everything, lamenting
their fate, they stood perched on the boughs, nine in number. As the

According to Plutarch, the adventure of the Muses with Pyreneus, and of
their asking wings of the Gods to save themselves, is a metaphor, which
shows that he, when reigning in Phocis, was no friend to learning. As he
had caused all the institutions in which it was taught to be destroyed,
it was currently reported, that he had offered violence to the Muses,
and that he lost his life in pursuing them. Ovid is the only writer that
mentions him by name.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The challenge given by the Pierides to the Muses is not mentioned by any
writer before the time of Ovid. By way of explaining it, it is said,
that Pierus was a very bad poet, whose works were full of stories
injurious to the credit of the Gods. Hence, in time, it became
circulated, that his
<span class = "pagenum bell">170</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">V. 341-358</span>
daughters, otherwise his works, were changed into magpies, thereby
meaning that they were full of idle narratives, tiresome and unmeaning.
It is not improbable that the story of Typhœus, who forces the Gods to
conceal themselves in Egypt, under the forms of various animals, was a
poem which Pierus composed on the war of the Gods with the Giants.</p>

The ancients frequently accounted for natural phænomena on fabulous
grounds: and whatever they found difficult to explain, from their
ignorance of the principles of natural philosophy, they immediately
attributed to the agency of a supernatural cause. Ætna was often seen to
emit flames, and the earth was subjected to violent shocks from the
forces of its internal
<span class = "pagenum bell">172</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">V. 385-390</span>
fires when struggling for a vent. Instead of looking for the source of
these eruptions in the sulphur and bituminous matter in which the
mountain abounds, they fabled, that the Gods, having vanquished the
Giant Typhœus, or, according to some authors, Enceladus, threw Mount

inconsolable wound, and is entirely dissolved into tears, and melts away

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
The story of the rape of Proserpine has caused much inquiry among
writers, both ancient and modern, as to the facts on which it was
founded. Some have grounded it on principles of natural philosophy;
while others have supposed it to contain some portion of ancient
history, defaced and blemished in lapse of time.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The antiquarian Pezeron is of opinion, that in the partition of
<span class = "pagenum mckay">198</span>
the world among the Titan kings, Pluto had the west for his share; and
that he carried a colony to the further end of Spain, where he caused
the gold and silver mines of that region to be worked. The situation of
his kingdom, which lay very low, comparatively with Greece, and which
the ancients believed to be covered with eternal darkness, gave rise to
the fable, that Pluto had got Hell for his share; and this notion was
much encouraged by the subterranean nature of the mines which he caused
to be worked. He thinks that the river Tartarus, so famed in the realms
of Pluto, was no other than the Tartessa, or Guadalquivir of the present
day, which runs through the centre of Spain. Lethe, too, he thinks to
have been the Guadalaviar, in the same country. Pluto, he suggests, had
heard of the beauty of Proserpine, the daughter of Ceres, queen of
Sicily, and carried her thence, which gave rise to the tradition that
she had been carried to the Infernal Regions.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Le Clerc, on the other hand, thinks that it was not Pluto that carried
away Proserpine, but Aidoneus, king of Epirus, or Orcus king of the
Molossians. Aidoneus is supposed to have wrought mines in his kingdom,
and, as the entrance into it was over a river called Acheron, that
prince has often been confounded with Pluto; Epirus too, which was
situate very low, may have been figuratively described as the Infernal
Regions; for which reason, the journeys of Theseus and Hercules into
Epirus may have been spoken of as descents into the Stygian abodes.
Le&nbsp;Clerc supposes that Ceres was reigning in Sicily at the time
when Aidoneus was king of Epirus, and that she took great care to
instruct her subjects in the art of tilling the ground and sowing corn,
and established laws for regulating civil government and the
preservation of private property; for which reasons she was afterward
deemed to be the Goddess of the Earth, and of Corn. Cicero and Diodorus
Siculus tell us that Ceres made her residence at Enna, or Henna, in
Sicily, which name, according to Bochart, signifies ‘agreeable
fountain.’ Cicero and Strabo agree with Ovid in telling us that
Proserpine, the only daughter of Ceres, whom other writers name
Pherephata, was walking in the adjacent meadows, and gathering flowers
with her companions; upon which, certain pirates seized her, and,
placing her in a chariot, carried her to the seaside, whence they
embarked for Epirus. As Pausanias tells us, it was immediately spread
abroad, that Aidoneus, or Pluto, as he was called, had done it, the act
having been really committed by others, according to his orders. As
those who carried her off concealed themselves in the caverns of Mount
Ætna, awaiting their opportunity to escape, it was afterwards fabled
that Pluto came out of the Infernal Regions at that
<span class = "pagenum bell">177</span>
place; as that mountain, from its nature, was always deemed one of the
outlets of Hell. Upon this, Ceres went to Greece, in search of her
daughter; and, resting at Eleusis, in Attica, she heard that the ship in
which her daughter was carried away had sailed westward. On this, she
complained to Jupiter, one of the Titan kings, but could obtain no
further satisfaction than that her daughter should be permitted to visit
her occasionally, whereby, at length, her grief was mitigated.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Banier does not agree with these suggestions of Pezeron and
Le&nbsp;Clerc, and thinks that Ceres is no other personage than the Isis
of <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "‘the’ missing in McKay">the</ins>
Egyptians, supposing that the story is founded on the following
<span class = "pagenum mckay">199</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">V. 462-463</span>
circumstance:&mdash;<ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘circumstances’">Greece</ins>, he says, was afflicted with famine in the
reign of Erectheus, who was obliged to send to Egypt for corn, when
those who went for it brought back the worship of the Deity who presided
over agriculture. The evils which the Athenians had suffered by the
famine, and the dread of again incurring the same calamity, made them
willingly embrace the rites of a Goddess whom they believed able to
protect them from it. Triptolemus established her worship in Eleusis,
and there instituted the mysteries which he had brought over from Egypt.
These had been previously introduced into Sicily, which was the reason
why it was said that Ceres came from Sicily to Athens. Her daughter was
said to have been taken away, because corn and fruit had not been
produced in sufficient quantities, for some time, to furnish food for
the people. Pluto was said to have carried her to the Infernal regions,
because the grain and seeds at that time remained buried, as it were, at
the very center of the earth. Jupiter was said to have decided the
difference between Ceres and Pluto, because the earth again became
covered with crops.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
This appears to be an ingenious allegorical explanation of the story;
but it is not at all improbable that it may have been founded upon
actual facts, and that, having lost her daughter, and going to Attica to
seek her, Ceres taught Triptolemus the mysteries of Isis; and that, in
process of time, Ceres, having become enrolled among the Divinities of
Greece, her worship became confounded with that of Isis.</p>

of her grief, she departed in her chariot into the ætherial air, and
there, with her countenance all clouded, she stood before Jupiter, much
to his discredit, with her hair dishevelled; and she said, “I have come,
Jupiter, as a suppliant to thee, both for my own offspring and for
thine. If thou hast no respect for the mother, <i>still</i> let the

a&nbsp;daughter of thine is not deserving of a ravisher for a husband,

give right names to things, this deed is not an injury, but it is <ins

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
Apollodorus says, that the terms of the treaty respecting Proserpine
were, that she should stay on earth nine months with Ceres, and three
with Pluto, in the Infernal Regions. Other writers divide the time
equally; six months to Ceres, and six to Pluto. They also tell us that
the story of Ascalaphus is founded on the fact, that he was one of the
courtiers of Pluto, who, having advised his master to carry away
Proserpine, did all that lay in his power to obstruct the endeavors of
Ceres, and hinder the restoration of her daughter, on which Proserpine
had him privately destroyed; to screen which deed the Fable was
invented; the pernicious counsels which he gave his master being
signified by the seeds of the pomegranate. It has also been suggested
that the story of his change into an owl was based on the circumstance
that he was the overseer of the mines of Pluto, in which he perished,
removed from the light of day. Perhaps he was there crushed to death by
the fall of a rock, which caused the poets to say that Proserpine had
covered him with a large stone, as Apollodorus informs us, who also says
that it was Ceres who inflicted the punishment upon him. The name
‘Ascalaphus’ signifies, ‘one that breaks stones,’ and, very probably,
that name was only given him to denote his employment. Some writers
state that he was changed into a lizard, which the Greeks call
‘Ascalabos,’ and, probably, the resemblance between the names gave rise
to this version of the story.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Probably, the story of the Nymph Cyane reproaching Pluto with his
treatment of Proserpine, and being thereupon changed by him into a
fountain, has no other foundation than the propinquity of the place

into birds, that they might seek for Proserpine, on the ground of some
existing tradition, that living on the coast of Italy, near the island
of Sicily, and having heard of the misfortune that had befallen her,
they ordered a ship with sails to be equipped to go in search of her.

keep up the chase; for he was able to endure prolonged fatigue. However,
I&nbsp;ran over fields <i>and</i> over mountains covered with trees,
rocks too, and crags, and where there was no path. The sun was upon my
back; I&nbsp;saw a long shadow advancing before my feet, unless,
perhaps, it was my fear that

fillets of my hair. Wearied with the exertion of my flight, I&nbsp;said,
‘Give aid, Dictynna, to thy armor-bearer, <i>or</i> I am overtaken;

dense clouds, she threw it over me. The river looked about for me,
concealed in the darkness, and, in his ignorance sought about the

lurking in the bush, beholds the hostile noses of the dogs, and dares
not make a single movement with her body? Yet he does not depart; for no

having laid aside the shape of a mortal, which he had assumed, he was

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
Bochart tells us that the story of the fountain Arethusa and the river
Alpheus, her lover, who traversed so many countries in pursuit of her,
has no other foundation than an equivocal expression in the language of
the first inhabitants of Sicily. The Phœnicians, who went to settle in
<span class = "pagenum bell">186</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">V. 642-651</span>
that island, finding the fountain surrounded with willows, gave it the
name of ‘Alphaga,’ or ‘the fountain of the willows.’ Others, again, gave
it the name of ‘Arith,’ signifying ‘a stream.’ The Greeks, arriving
there in after ages, not understanding the signification of these words,
and remembering their own river Alpheus, in Elis, imagined that since
the river and the fountain had nearly the same name, Alpheus had crossed
the sea, to arrive in Sicily.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
This notion appearing, probably, to the poets not devoid of ingenuity,
they accordingly founded on it the romantic story of the passion of the
river God Alpheus for the Nymph Arethusa. Some of the ancient historians
appear, however, in their credulity, really to have believed, at least,
a&nbsp;part of the story, as they seriously tell us, that the river
Alpheus passes under the bed of the sea, and rises again in Sicily, near
the fountain of Arethusa. Even among the more learned, this fable gained
credit; for we find the oracle <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘at’">of</ins> Delphi ordering Archias to conduct a colony of
Corinthians to Syracuse, and the priestess giving the following
directions:&mdash;‘Go into that island where the river Alpheus mixes his
waters with the fair Arethusa.’</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Pausanias avows, that he regards the story of Alpheus and Arethusa as a
mere <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘fable!’">fable;</ins> but, not daring to dispute a fact established by
the response of an oracle, he does not contradict the fact of the river
running through the sea, though he is at a loss to understand how it can
happen.</p>

trifling matter for you to have merited punishment by this contest, you
add abuse, too, to your fault, and endurance is not permitted us: we
shall proceed to punishment, and whither our resentment calls, we shall
follow.’ The Emathian sisters smiled, and despised our threatening
language; and endeavoring to speak, and to menace with their insolent
hands amid great clamor, they beheld quills growing out of their nails,
and their arms covered with feathers. And they each see the face of the

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
Triptolemus reigned at Eleusis at the time when the mysteries of Ceres
were established there. As we are told by Philochorus, he went with a
ship, to carry corn into different countries, and introduced there the
worship of Ceres, whose priest he was. This is, doubtless, the key for
the
<span class = "pagenum bell">188</span>
explanation of the story, that Ceres nursed him on her own milk, and
purified him by fire. Some have supposed that the fable refers to the
epoch when agriculture was introduced into Greece: but it is much more
probable that it relates simply to the introduction there of the
mysterious worship of Ceres, which was probably imported from Egypt. It
is possible that, at the same period, the Greeks may have learned some
improved method of tilling the ground, acquired by their intercourse
with Egypt.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Probably, the dangers which Triptolemus experienced in his voyages and
travels, gave rise to the story of Lyncus, whose cruelty caused him to
be changed into a lynx. Bochart and Le&nbsp;Clerc think that the fable
of Triptolemus being drawn by winged dragons, is based upon the
equivocal meaning of a Phœnician word, which <ins class = "corr mckay"
title = "McKay reads ‘signifies’">signified</ins> either ‘a winged
dragon,’ or ‘a ship fastened
<span class = "pagenum mckay">211</span>
with iron nails <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘and’">or</ins> bolts.’ Philochorus, however, as cited by Eusebius, says
that his ship was called a flying dragon, from its carrying the figure
of a dragon on its prow. We learn from a fragment of Stobæus, that
Erectheus, when engaged in a war against the Eleusinians, was told by
the oracle that he would be victorious, if he sacrificed his daughter
Proserpine. This, perhaps, may have given rise, or added somewhat, to
the story of the rape of Proserpine by Pluto.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
According to a fragment of Homer, cited by Pausanias, the names of the
first Greeks, who were initiated into the mysteries of Ceres,
were,&mdash;Celeus, Triptolemus, Eumolpus, and Diocles. Clement of
Alexandria calls them Baubon, Dysaulus, Eubuleüs, Eumolpus, and
Triptolemus. Eumolpus being the Hierophant, or explainer of the
mysteries of <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘Eleusi’">Eleusis</ins>, made war against Erectheus, king of Athens.
They were both killed in battle, and it was thereupon agreed that the
posterity of Erectheus should be kings of Athens, and the descendants of
Eumolpus should, in future, retain the office of Hierophant.</p>

Hippodamia. On this occasion he exacted a promise from Perseus, of the
head of the Gorgon Medusa. When Perseus returned victorious, he found
that his mother, with her protector Dictys, had taken refuge at the
altars of the Deities, against the violence of Polydectes; on which
Perseus changed him into stone. The story of Perseus afforded abundant
materials to the ancient poets. Æschylus wrote a Tragedy called
Polydectes, Sophocles one called Danaë, while Euripides composed two,
called respectively Danaë and Dictys. Pherecydes also wrote on this

<a name = "note5_46" id = "note5_46" href = "#tag5_46">46.</a>
<i>Henna.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 385. Henna, or Enna, was a city so exactly
situated in the middle of Sicily that it was called the navel of that
island. The worship of Ceres there was so highly esteemed, that ancient
writers remarked, that you might easily take the whole place for one
vast temple of that Goddess, and all the inhabitants for her priests.
Proserpine is said by many authors, besides Ovid, to have been carried
away by Pluto in the vicinity of Henna; though some writers say that it
took place in Attica, and others again in Asia, while the Hymn of
Orpheus mentions the western coast of Spain. Cicero describes this spot
in his Oration against Verres: his words are, ‘It is said that Libera,
who is the Deity that we call Proserpine, was carried away from the
Grove of Enna. Enna, where these events took place to which I now refer,
is in a lofty and exposed situation; but on the summit the ground
presents a level surface, and there are springs of everflowing water.
The spot is entirely cut off and separated from all [ordinary] means of
approach. Around it are many lakes and groves, and flowers in bloom at
all seasons of the year; so that the very spot seems to portray the rape
of the damsel, with which story, from our very infancy, we have been
familiar. Close by, there is a cavern with its face towards the north,
of an immense depth, from which they say that father Pluto, in his
chariot, suddenly emerged, and carrying off the maiden, bore her away
from that spot, and then, not far from Syracuse, descended into the
earth, from which place a lake suddenly arose; where, at the present
day, the inhabitants of Syracuse celebrate a yearly festival.’</p>

<i>The <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘Palaci’">Palici</ins>.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 406. The Palici were two
brothers, sons of Jupiter and the Nymph Thalea, and, according to some,
received their name from the Greek words <span class = "greek" title =
"palin hikesthai">πάλιν ἱκέσθαι</span>, ‘to come again [to life].’ Their
mother, when pregnant, prayed the earth to open, and to hide her from
the vengeful wrath of Juno. This was done; and when they had arrived at
maturity, the Palici burst from the ground in the island of Sicily. They
were Deities much venerated there, but their worship did not extend to
any other countries. We learn from Macrobius that the natives of Sicily
pointed out two small lakes, from which the brothers were said to have
emerged, and that the veneration attached to them was such, that by
their means they decided disputes, as they imagined that perjurers would
meet their death in these waters, while the guiltless would be able to
come forth from them unharmed. They were fetid, sulphureous pools of
water, probably affected by the volcanic action of Mount Ætna.</p>

Corinth, was said to have founded Syracuse, the capital of Sicily. The
family sprang either from Bacchius, a&nbsp;son of <ins class = "corr
mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘Dionysius’">Dionysus</ins>, or Bacchus, or
from the fifth king of Corinth, who was named Bacchis. The family was
expelled from Corinth by Cypselus, either on account of their luxury and
extravagant mode of life, or because they were supposed to aim at the
sovereignty.</p>

mingling with the waters of the fountain Cyane, falls into the sea at
Syracuse, opposite to the island of Ortygia. This island, in which the
fountain of Arethusa was situate, was separated from the isle of Sicily
by a narrow strait of the sea, and communicating with the city of
Syracuse by a bridge, was considered as part of it.</p>

Book of the Fasti, Melanina.</p>

called by the Romans ‘<ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘cinus’">cinnus</ins>;’ made of parched pearled barley, honey, and wine,
with flowers and various herbs floating in it. Antoninus Liberalis says,

<i>The girdle.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 470. The zone, or girdle,
a&nbsp;fastening round the loins, <ins class = "corr mckay" title =
"McKay reads ‘were’">was</ins> much <ins class = "corr bell" title =
"Bell reads ‘wore’">worn</ins> by both sexes among the ancients. It was
sometimes made of netted work, and the chief use of it was for holding
up the tunic, and keeping it from dragging on the ground. Among the
Romans, the Magister Equitum, or ‘Master of the Horse,’ wore a girdle of
red leather, embroidered by the needle, and having its extremities
joined by a gold buckle. It also formed part of the cuirass of the
warrior. The girdle was used sometimes by men to hold money instead of a
purse; and the ‘pera,’ ‘wallet,’ or ‘purse,’ was generally fastened to
the girdle. As this article of dress was used to hold up the garments
for the sake of expedition, it was loosened when people were supposed to
be abstracted from the cares of the world, as in performing sacrifice or
attending at funeral rites. A&nbsp;girdle was also worn by the young
women, even when the tunic was not girt up; and it was only discontinued
by them on the day of marriage. To that circumstance, allusion is made
in the present instance, as a proof of the violence that had been
committed on Proserpine.</p>

<a name = "note5_63" id = "note5_63" href = "#tag5_63">63.</a>
<i>Beheld by my eyes.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 505. Ovid here makes Arethusa the
discoverer to Ceres of the fate of her daughter. In the Fourth Book of
the Fasti, he represents the Sun as giving her that information, in
which he follows the account given by Homer. Apollodorus describes the
descent of Pluto as taking place at Hermione, a&nbsp;town of Argolis, in
Peloponnesus, and the people of that place as informing Ceres of what
had happened to her daughter.</p>

<i>If you call it finding.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 520. This remark of the
Goddess is very like that of the Irish sailor, who vowed that a thing
could not be said to be lost when one knows where it is; and that his
master’s kettle was quite safe, for he knew it to be at the bottom of
the sea.</p>

<p>
<a name = "note5_65" id = "note5_65" href = "#tag5_65">65.</a>
<i>Plucked a pomegranate.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 535. It was for this reason
that the Thesmophoriazusæ, in the performance of the rites of Ceres,
were especially careful not to taste the pomegranate. This fruit was
most probably called ‘malum,’ or ‘pomum punicum,’ or ‘puniceum,’ from
the deep red or purple color of the inside, and not as having been first
introduced from Phœnicia.</p>

<i>Ascalaphus.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 539. He was the son of Acheron, by the
Nymph Orphne, or Gorgyra, according to Apollodorus. The latter author
says, that for his unseasonable discovery, Ceres placed a rock upon him;
but that, having been liberated by Hercules, she changed him into an
owl, called <span class = "greek" title = "ôton">ὦτον</span>. The Greek
name of a lizard <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "‘being’ missing in McKay">being</ins> <span class = "greek" title =

story of Ascalaphus.</p>

<i>Avernus.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 540. Avernus was a lake of Campania, near
Baiæ, of a fetid smell and gloomy aspect. Being feigned to be the mouth,
or threshold, of the Infernal Regions, its name became generally used to
signify Tartarus, or the Infernal Regions. The name is said to have been
derived from the Greek word <span class = "greek" title =

they could not endure the exhalations that were emitted by it.</p>

forsake their streams. And not only did it give them pleasure to look at
the garments when made, but even, too, while they were being made, so
much grace was there in her working. Whether it was that she was rolling
the rough wool into its first balls, or whether she was unravelling the
work with her fingers, and was softening the fleeces worked over again
with long drawings out, equalling the mists <i>in their fineness</i>; or
whether she was moving the <i>smooth</i> round spindle with her nimble
thumb, or was embroidering with the needle, you might perceive that she
had been instructed by Pallas.</p>

<p>This, however, she used to deny; and, being displeased with a
mistress so famed, she said, “Let her contend with me. There is nothing
which, if conquered, I&nbsp;should refuse <i>to endure</i>.” Pallas
personates an old woman; she both places false gray hair on her temples,
and supports as well her infirm limbs by a staff. Then thus she begins
to speak: “Old age has not everything which we should avoid; experience
comes from lengthened years. Do not despise my advice; let the greatest
fame for working wool be sought by thee among mortals. <i>But</i> yield
to the Goddess, and, rash woman, ask pardon for thy speeches with
suppliant voice. She will grant pardon at my entreaty.” <i>The other</i>
beholds her with scowling <i>eyes</i>, and leaves the threads she has
begun; and scarcely restraining her hand, and discovering her anger by
her looks, with such words as these does she reply to the disguised
Pallas: “Thou comest <i>here</i> bereft of thy understanding, and worn
out with prolonged old age; and it is thy misfortune to have lived too
long. If thou hast any daughter-in-law, if thou hast any daughter <i>of
thy own</i>, let her listen to these remarks. I&nbsp;have sufficient

<span class = "linenum mckay">VI. 42-67</span>
opinion is <i>still</i> the same. Why does not she come herself? why
does she decline this contest?”</p>

<p>Then the Goddess says, “Lo! she is come;” and she casts aside the
figure of an old woman, and shows herself <i>as</i> Pallas. The Nymphs
and the Mygdonian<a class = "tag" name = "tag6_6" id = "tag6_6" href =

The virgin alone is not daunted. But still she blushes, and a sudden
flush marks her reluctant features, and again it vanishes; <i>just</i>
as the sky is wont to become tinted with purple, when Aurora is first
stirring, and after a short time to grow white from the influence of the
Sun. She persists in her determination, and, from a desire for a foolish
victory, she rushes upon her own destruction. Nor, indeed, does the
daughter of Jupiter decline <i>it</i>, or advise her any further, nor
does she now put off the contest. There is no delay; they both take
their stand in different places, and stretch out two webs <i>on the
loom</i> with a fine warp. The web is tied around the beam; the <ins

middle with sharp shuttles, which the fingers hurry along, and being
drawn within the warp, the teeth notched in the moving sley strike it.
Both hasten on, and girding up their garments to their breasts, they
move their skilful arms, their eagerness beguiling their fatigue. There
both the purple is being woven, which is subjected to the Tyrian brazen

the same; and yet the extremes are different. There, too, the

four times did she strike the forehead of Arachne, the daughter of
Idmon. The unhappy creature could not endure it; and being of a high
spirit, she tied up her throat in a halter. Pallas, taking compassion,
bore her up as she hung; and thus she said: “Live on indeed, wicked
one,<a class = "tag" name = "tag6_29" id = "tag6_29" href =

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
The story of Arachne is most probably based upon the simple fact, that
she was the most skilful artist of her time, at working in silk and
wool. Pliny the Elder tells us, that Arachne, the daughter of Idmon,
a&nbsp;Lydian by birth, and of low extraction, invented the art of
making linen cloths and nets; which invention was also by some
attributed to Minerva. This competition, then, for the merit of the
invention, is the foundation of the challenge here described by the
Poet. As, however, Arachne is said to have hanged herself in despair,
she probably fell a prey to some cause of grief or discontent, the
particulars of which, in their simple form, have
<span class = "pagenum bell">196</span>
not come down to us. Perhaps the similarity of her name and employment
with those of the spider, as known among the Greeks, gave rise to the
story of her alleged transformation; unless <ins class = "corr mckay"
title = "McKay reads ‘he’">we</ins> should prefer to attribute the story
to the fact of the Hebrew word “arag,” signifying to spin, and, in some
degree, resembling her name.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
In this story, Ovid takes the opportunity of touching upon several
fables, the subjects whereof he states to have been represented in the
works of Minerva and Arachne. He alludes, among other matters, to the
dispute between Neptune and Minerva, about giving a name to the city of
Athens. St.&nbsp;<ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘Augustin’">Augustine</ins>, on the authority of Varro, says, that
Cecrops, in building that city, found an olive tree and a fountain, and
that the oracle at Delphi, on being consulted, stating that both Minerva
and Neptune had a right to name the city, the Senate decided in favor of
the Goddess; and this circumstance, he says, gave rise to the story.
According to some writers, it was based on the fact, that Cranaüs
changed the name of the city from Poseidonius, which it was called after
Neptune, to Athenæ, after his own daughter Athena: and as the Areiopagus
sanctioned this change, it was fabled that Neptune had been overcome by
the judgment of the Gods.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The Jesuit Tournemine suggests the following explanation of the
story:&mdash;He says, that the aborigines of Attica, being conquered by
the Pelasgians, learned from them the art of navigation, which they
turned to account by becoming pirates. Cecrops, bringing a
<span class = "pagenum mckay">220</span>
colony from Saïs, in Egypt, tried to abolish this barbarous custom, and
taught them a more civilized mode of life; and, among other things, he
showed them how to till the earth, and to raise the olive, for the
cultivation of which he found the soil very favorable. He also
introduced the worship of Minerva, or Athena, as she was called,
a&nbsp;Goddess highly honored at Saïs, and to whom the olive tree was
dedicated. Her the Athenians afterwards regarded as the patroness of
their city, which they called after her name. Athens becoming famous for
its olives, and, considerable profit arising from their cultivation, the
new settlers attempted to wean the natives from piracy, by calling their
attention to <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘agricultual’">agricultural</ins> pursuits. To succeed in this, they
composed a fable, in which Neptune was said to be overcome by Minerva;
who, even in the judgment of the twelve greater deities, had found out
something of more utility than he. This fable Tournemine supposes to
have been composed in the ancient language of the country, which was the
Phrygian, mingled with many Phœnician words; and, as in those languages
the same word signifies either a ship or a horse, those who afterwards
interpreted the fable, took the word in the latter signification, and
spoke of a horse instead of a ship, which was really the original emblem
employed in the fiction.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Vossius thinks that the fable originated in a dispute between the
sailors of Athens, who acknowledged Neptune for their chief, and the
people, who followed the Senate, governed by Minerva. The people
prevailed, and a life of civilization, marked by attention to the
pursuits of agriculture, was substituted for one of piracy; which gave
occasion for the saying, that Minerva had overcome Neptune.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
With reference to the intrigues and lustful actions attributed to the
<span class = "pagenum bell">197</span>
various Deities by Arachne in the delineations on her embroidery, we may
here remark, by way of elucidating the origin of these stories in
general, that, in early times, when the earth was sunk in ignorance and
superstition, and might formed the only right in the heathen world,
where a king or petty chieftain demanded the daughter of a neighbor in
marriage, and met with a refusal, he immediately had recourse to arms,
to obtain her by force. Their standards and ships, on these expeditions,
carrying their ensigns, consisting of birds, beasts, or fabulous
monsters, gave occasion to those who described their feats of prowess to
say, that the ravisher had changed himself into a bull, an eagle, or a
lion, for the purpose of effecting his object. The kings and potentates
of those days, being frequently called Jupiter, Apollo, Neptune, etc.,
and the priests of the Gods so named often obtaining their ends by
assuming the names of the Divinities they served, we can account the
more easily for the number of intrigues and abominable actions, attended
by changes and transformations, which the poets and mythologists
attribute to many of the Deities.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Palæphatus suggests a very ingenious method of accounting for these
stories; founded, however, it must be owned, on a very low estimate of
female virtue in those times. He says, that these fabulous narratives
originate in the figures of different animals which were engraved on the
coins of those times; and that, when money was given to buy over or to
procure the seduction of a female, it was afterward said that the lover
had himself taken <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘the // the’ at page break">the</ins>
<span class = "pagenum mckay">221</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">VI. 146-148</span>
figure which was represented on the coin, by means of which his object
had been effected.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Ovid, in common with many of the ancient historians, geographers, and
naturalists, mentions the Pygmies, of which, from the time of Homer
downwards, a&nbsp;nation was supposed to exist, in a state of continual
warfare with the Cranes. Aristotle, who believed in their existence,
placed them in Æthiopia; Pliny, Solinus, and Philostratus in India, near
the source of the Ganges; others again, in Scythia, on the banks of the
Danube. Some of the moderns have attempted to explain the origin of this
prevalent notion. Olaüs Magnus thinks the Samoeids and Laplanders to
have been the Pygmies of Homer. Gesner and others fancy that they have
found their originals in Thuringia; while Albertus Magnus supposed that
the Pygmies were the monkeys, which are so numerous <ins class = "corr
mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘is’">in</ins> the interior of Africa, and
which were taken for human beings of diminutive stature. Vander Hart,
who has written a most ingenious treatise on the subject, suggests that
the fable originated in a war between two cities in Greece, Pagæ and
Gerania, the similarity of whose names to those of the Pygmies and the
Cranes, gave occasion to their neighbors, the Corinthians, to confer on
them those nicknames. It is most probable, however, that the story was
founded upon the diminutive stature of some of the native tribes of the
interior of Africa.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
As to the fable of Pygas being changed into a crane, Banier suggests,
that the origin of it may be found in the work of Antoninus Liberalis,
quoting from the Theogony of Bœus. That poet, whose works are lost,
says, that among the Pygmies there was a very beautiful princess, named
Œnoë, who greatly oppressed her subjects. Having married Nicodamas, she
had by him a son, named Mopsus, whom her subjects seized upon, to
<span class = "pagenum bell">198</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">VI. 146-166</span>
educate him in their own way. She accordingly raised levies against her
own subjects; and that circumstance, together with the name of Gerane,
which, according to Ælian, she also bore, gave rise to the fable, which
said that she was changed into a crane; the resemblance which it bore to
‘geranos,’ the Greek for ‘a crane,’ suggesting the foundation of the
story.</p>

said, “Thou dost roam a stranger on the land, I&nbsp;in the waves;” and
gave her an unstable place <i>of rest</i>. She was made the mother of
two children, that is <i>but</i> the seventh part of my issue. I&nbsp;am
fortunate, and who shall deny it? and fortunate I shall remain; who,
too, can doubt of that?
<span class = "pagenum bell">200</span>

Plenty has made me secure; I&nbsp;am too great for Fortune possibly to
hurt; and, though she should take away many things from me, <i>even
then</i> much more will she leave me: my <i>many</i> blessings have now
risen superior to apprehensions. Suppose it possible for some part of
this multitude of my children to be taken away <i>from me</i>; still,
thus stripped, I&nbsp;shall not be reduced to two, the number of Latona;
an amount, by the number of which, how far, <i>I pray</i>, is she
removed from one that is childless? Go from the sacrifice;
<span class = "pagenum mckay">224</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">VI. 200-230</span>
hasten away from the sacrifice, and remove the laurel from your
hair!”</p>

<p>They remove it, and the sacrifice they leave unperformed; and what
they can do, they adore the Divinity in gentle murmurs. The Goddess was
indignant; and on the highest top of <i>Mount</i> Cynthus, she spoke to
her two children in such words as these: “Behold! I,&nbsp;your mother,
proud of having borne you, and who shall yield to no one of the
Goddesses, except to Juno <i>alone</i>, am called in question whether I
am a Goddess, and, for all future ages, I&nbsp;am driven from the altars
devoted <i>to me</i>, unless you give me aid. Nor is this my only grief;
the daughter of Tantalus has added abusive language to her shocking
deeds, and has dared to postpone you to her own children, and (what <ins
class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘I {wish}’"><i>I

the profane <i>wretch</i> has discovered a tongue like her father’s.”<a
class = "tag" name = "tag6_38" id = "tag6_38" href = "#note6_38">38</a>
To this relation Latona was going to add entreaties, when Phœbus said,
“Cease thy complaints, ’tis prolonging the delay of her punishment.”
Phœbe said the same; and, by a speedy descent through the air, they
arrived, covered with clouds, at the citadel of Cadmus.</p>

<p>There was near the walls a plain, level, and extending far and wide,
trampled continually by horses, where multitudes of wheels and hard
hoofs had softened the clods placed beneath them. There, part of the
seven sons of Amphion are mounting upon their spirited steeds, and press
their backs, red with the Tyrian dye, and wield the reins heavy with
gold; of these, Ismenus, who had formerly been the first burden of his
mother, while he is guiding the steps of the horses in a perfect circle,
and is curbing their foaming mouths, cries aloud, “Ah, wretched me!”
and, pierced through the middle of his breast,
<span class = "pagenum bell">201</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">VI. 228-256</span>
bears a dart <i>therein</i>; and the reins dropping from his dying hand,
by degrees he falls on his side, over <i>the horse’s</i> shoulder. The
next <i>to him</i>, Sipylus, on hearing the sound of a quiver in the
air, gives
<span class = "pagenum mckay">225</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">VI. 230-256</span>
rein<a class = "tag" name = "tag6_39" id = "tag6_39" href =
"#note6_39">39</a> <i>to his horse</i>; as when the pilot, sensible of
the storm <i>approaching</i>, flies on seeing a cloud, and unfurls the
hanging sails on every side, that the light breeze may by no means
escape them. He gives rein, <i>I said</i>; while thus giving it, the
unerring dart overtakes him, and an arrow sticks quivering in the top of
his neck, and the bare steel protrudes from his throat. He, as he is
bending forward, rolls over the neck, <i>now</i> let loose, and
<i>over</i> the mane, and stains the ground with his warm blood. The
unhappy Phædimus, and Tantalus, the heir to the name of his grandsire,
when they had put an end to their wonted exercise <ins class = "corr
mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘of {riding}’"><i>of riding</i></ins>, had
turned to the youthful exercises of the palæstra, glowing with oil;<a

and now had they brought<a class = "tag" name = "tag6_41" id = "tag6_41"
href = "#note6_41">41</a> breast to breast, struggling in a close
grapple, when an arrow, sped onward from the stretched bow, pierced them
both, just as they were united together. At the same instant they
groaned aloud, and together they laid their limbs on the ground,
writhing with pain; together as they lay, for the last time, they rolled
their eyeballs, and together they breathed forth their life.</p>

<p>Alphenor sees this, and, beating his torn breast, flies to them, to
lift up their cold limbs in his embrace, and falls in this affectionate
duty. For the Delian God pierces the inner part of his midriff with the
fatal steel. Soon as it is pulled out, a&nbsp;part of his lungs is
dragged forth on the barbs, and his blood is poured forth, with his
life, into the air; but no single wound reaches the unshaven
Damasicthon. He is struck where the leg commences, and where the sinewy
ham
<span class = "pagenum bell">202</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">VI. 256-290</span>
makes the
<span class = "pagenum mckay">226</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">VI. 256-287</span>
space between the joints soft; and while he is trying with his hand to
draw out the fatal weapon, another arrow is driven through his neck, up
to the feathers. The blood drives this out, and itself starting forth,
springs up on high, and, piercing the air, spouts forth afar. The last
<i>of them</i>, Ilioneus, had raised his unavailing arms in prayer, and
had said, “O,&nbsp;all ye Gods, in common, (not knowing that all were
not to be addressed) spare me!” The <i>God</i>, the bearer of the bow,
was moved, when now his arrow could not be recalled; yet he died with
the slightest wound <i>of all</i>, his heart not being struck deep by
the arrow.</p>

<p>The report of this calamity, and the grief of the people, and the
tears of her family, made the mother acquainted with a calamity so
sudden, wondering that it could have happened, and enraged that the Gods
above had dared this, <i>and</i> that they enjoyed a privilege so great.
For Amphion the father, thrusting his sword through his breast, dying,
had ended his grief together with his life. Alas! how different is this
Niobe from that Niobe who had lately driven the people from the altars
of Latona, and, with lofty head, had directed her steps through the
midst of the city, envied by her own people, but now to be pitied even
by an enemy! She falls down upon the cold bodies, and with no
distinction she distributes her last kisses among all her sons. Raising
her livid arms from these towards heaven, she says, “Glut thyself, cruel
Latona, with my sorrow; glut thyself, and satiate thy breast with my
mourning; satiate, too, thy relentless heart with seven deaths.

the bent bow, which affrighted all but Niobe alone; she <i>became</i>
bold by her misfortunes.</p>

<span class = "pagenum bell">203</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">VI. 290-312</span>
drawing out the weapon sticking in her entrails, about to die, swooned
away, with her face placed upon her brother. Another, endeavoring to
console her wretched parent, was suddenly silent, and was doubled
together with an invisible wound; and did not close her mouth, until
after the breath had departed. Another, vainly flying, falls down;
another dies upon her sister; another lies hid; another you might see
trembling. And <i>now</i> six being put to death, and having received
different wounds, the last <i>only</i> remains; her mother covering her
with all her body, <i>and</i> with all her garments, cries, “Leave me
but one, and that the youngest; the youngest only do I ask out of so
many, and <i>that but</i> one.” And while she was entreating, she, for
whom she was entreating, was slain. Childless, she sat down among her
dead sons and daughters and husband, and became hardened by her woes.
The breeze moves no hair <i>of hers</i>; in her features is a color
without blood; her eyes stand unmoved in her sad cheeks; in her form
there is no <i>appearance</i> of life. Her tongue itself, too, congeals
within, together with her hardened palate, and the veins cease to be
able to be moved. Her neck can neither be bent, nor can her arms give
any motion, nor her feet move. Within her entrails, too, it is
stone.</p>

<p>Still did she weep on; and, enveloped in a hurricane of mighty wind,
she was borne away to her native land. There, fixed on the top of a

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
All the ancient historians agree with Diodorus Siculus and Apollodorus,
that Niobe was the daughter of Tantalus, and the sister of Pelops; but
she must not be confounded with a second Niobe, who was the daughter of
Phoroneus, and the first mortal (Homer tells us) with whom Jupiter fell
in love. Homer says that she was the mother of twelve children, six sons
and six daughters. Herodotus says, that she had but two sons and three
daughters. Diodorus Siculus makes her the mother of fourteen
<span class = "pagenum bell">204</span>
children, seven of each sex. Apollodorus, on the authority of Hesiod,
says, that she had ten sons and as many daughters; but gives the names
of fourteen only. The story of the destruction of her children is most
likely based upon truth, and bears reference to a historical fact. The
plague, which ravaged the city of Thebes, destroyed all the children of
Niobe; and contagious distempers being attributed to the excessive heat
of the sun, it was fabled that Apollo had killed them with his arrows;
while women, who died of the plague, were said to owe their death to the
anger of Diana. Thus, Homer says, that Laodamia and the mother of
Andromache were killed by Diana. Valerius Flaccus relates the sorrow of
<ins class = "corr bell" title = "Bell reads ‘Clyte’">Clytie</ins>, the
wife of Cyzicus, on the death of her mother, killed by the same Goddess;
so the Scholiast on Pindar (Pythia, ode iii.) says, on the authority of
Pherecydes, that Apollo sent Diana to kill Coronis and several other
women. Eustathius distinctly asserts, that the poets attributed the
deaths of men, who died of the plague, to Apollo; and those of women,
dying a similar death, to Diana.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
This supposition is based upon rational and just grounds; since many
contagious distempers may be clearly traced to the exhalations of the
earth, acted on by the intense heat of the sun. Homer, most probably,
means this, when he says that the plague came upon the Grecian camp, on
the God, in his anger, discharging his arrows against it; or, in other
words, when the extreme heat of his rays had caused a corruption of the
atmosphere. It may be here observed, that arrows were the symbol of
Apollo, when angry, and the harp when he was propitious. Diogenes
Laertius tells us, that, during the prevalence of the plague, it was the
custom to place branches of laurel on the doors of the houses, in the
hope that the God, being reminded of Daphne, would spare the places
which thereby claimed his protection.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Ovid says, that the sons of Niobe were killed while managing their
horses; but Pausanias tells us that they died on Mount Cithæron, while
engaged in hunting, and that her daughters died at Thebes. Homer says,
that her children remained nine days without burial, because the Gods
changed the Thebans into stones, and that the offended Divinities
themselves performed the funeral rites on the tenth day; the meaning
probably, is, that, they dying of the plague, no one ventured to bury
them, and all seemed insensible to the sorrows of Niobe, as each
consulted his own safety. Ismenus, her eldest son, not being able to
endure the pain of his malady, is said to have thrown himself into a
river of Bœotia,
<span class = "pagenum mckay">229</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">VI. 313-327</span>
which, from that circumstance, received his name. After the death of her
husband and children, Niobe is said to have retired to Mount Sipylus, in
Lydia, where she died. Here, as Pausanias informs us, was a rock,
resembling, at a distance, a&nbsp;woman overwhelmed with grief; though
according to the same author, who had visited it, the resemblance could
not be traced on approaching it. On this ground, Ovid relates, that she
was borne on a whirlwind to the top of a Lydian mountain, where she was
changed into a rock.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Pausanias tells us, that Melibœa, or Chloris, and Amycle, two of her
daughters, appeased Diana, who preserved their lives; or that, in other
words, they recovered from the plague; though he inclines to credit the
version of Homer, who says that all of her children died by the hands of
<span class = "pagenum bell">205</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">VI. 313-341</span>
Apollo and Diana. Melibœa received the surname of Chloris, from the
paleness which ensued on her alarm at the sudden death of her
sisters.</p>

The thing, indeed, is but little known, through the obscure station of
the individuals, still it is wonderful. I&nbsp;have seen upon the spot,
the pool and the lake noted for the miracle. For my father being now
advanced in years, and incapable of travel, ordered me to bring thence
some choice oxen, and on my setting out, had given me a guide of that
nation: with whom, while I was traversing the pastures, behold! an
ancient altar, black with the ashes of sacrifices, was standing in the
middle of a lake, surrounded with quivering reeds. My guide stood still,
and said in a timid whisper, ‘Be propitious to me;’ and
<span class = "pagenum mckay">230</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">VI. 328-349</span>
with a like whisper, I said, ‘Be propitious.’ However, I&nbsp;asked him
whether it was an altar of the Naiads, or of Faunus, or of some native
God; when the stranger answered me in such words; <a class = "tag" name

of Pallas, brought forth twins, in spite of their stepmother
<i>Juno</i>. Hence, too, the newly delivered <i>Goddess</i> is said to
have fled from Juno, and in her bosom to have carried the two
divinities, her children. And now the Goddess, wearied with her
prolonged toil, being parched with the heat of the season,

"tag" name = "tag6_46" id = "tag6_46" href = "#note6_46">46</a> of fine
water, in the bottom of a valley; some countrymen were there, gathering
bushy osiers, together with bulrushes, and sedge natural to fenny spots.
The Titaness approached, and bending her knee, she pressed the ground,
that she might take up the cool water to drink; the company of rustics
forbade it. The Goddess thus addressed them, as they forbade her: ‘Why
do you deny me water? The use of water is common

<span class = "linenum mckay">VI. 350-376</span>

stream, the property of any one. To her public bounty have I come, which
yet I humbly beg of you to grant me. I&nbsp;was not intending to bathe
my limbs here, and my wearied joints, but to relieve my thirst. My
mouth, as I speak, lacks moisture, and my jaws are parched, and scarce
is there a passage for my voice therein; a&nbsp;draught of water will be
nectar to me, and I shall own, that, together with it, I&nbsp;have
received my life <i>at your hands</i>. In <i>that</i> water you will be
giving me life. Let these, too, move you, who hold out their little arms

<p>“What person might not these kindly words of the Goddess have been
able to influence? Still, they persist in hindering <i>the Goddess
thus</i> entreating them; and moreover add threats and abusive language,
if she does not retire to a distance. Nor is this enough. They likewise
muddy the lake itself <i>with</i> their feet and hands; and they raise

endure to utter words below <i>the majesty of</i> a Goddess; and raising
her hands to heaven, she says, ‘For ever may you live in that pool.’ The

<p class = "explanation">
Marsyas was the son of Hyagnis, the inventor of a peculiar kind of
flute, and of the Phrygian measure. Livy and <ins class = "corr mckay"
title = "McKay reads ‘Quintius’">Quintus</ins> Curtius
<span class = "pagenum mckay">234</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">VI. 412-415</span>
tell us, that the story of Apollo and Marsyas is an allegory; and that
the river Marsyas gave rise to it. They say that the river, falling from
a precipice, in the neighborhood of the town of Celenæ, in Phrygia, made
a very stunning and unpleasant noise; but that the smoothness of its
course afterwards gave occasion for the saying, that the vengeance of
Apollo had rendered it more tractable.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
It is, however, not improbable that the story may have been based on
historical facts. Having learned from his father, Hyagnis, the art of
playing on the flute, and, proud of his skill, at a time when the
musical art was yet in its infancy, <ins class = "corr mckay" title =
"McKay reads ‘Maryas’">Marsyas</ins> may have been rash enough to
challenge either a priest of Apollo, or some prince who bore that name,
and, for his presumption, to have received the punishment described by
Ovid. Herodotus certainly credited the story; for he says that the skin
of the unfortunate musician was to be seen, in his time, in the town of
Celenæ. Strabo, Pausanias, and Aulus Gellius also believe its truth.
Suidas tells us, that Marsyas, mortified at his defeat, threw himself
into the river that runs near Celenæ, which, from that time, bore his
name. Strabo says, that Marsyas had stolen the flute from Minerva, which
proved so fatal to him, and had thereby drawn upon himself the
indignation of that Divinity. Ovid, in the Sixth Book of the Fasti, and
Pausanias, quoting from Apollodorus, tell us, that Minerva, having
observed, by seeing herself in the river Meander, that, when she played
on the flute, her cheeks were swelled out in an unseemly manner, threw
aside the flute in her disgust, and Marsyas finding it, learned to play
on it so skilfully, that he challenged Apollo to a trial of proficiency.
Hyginus, in his 165th Fable, says that Marsyas was the son of Œagrius,
and not Hyagnis; perhaps, however, this is a corrupt reading.</p>

Thracian Tereus had routed these by his auxiliary forces, and by his
conquest had acquired an illustrious name. Him, powerful both in riches
and men, and, as it happened, deriving his descent from the mighty
Gradivus, Pandion united to himself, by the marriage of <i>his
daughter</i> Progne.</p>

<p>Neither Juno, the guardian of marriage rites, nor yet Hymeneus, nor
the Graces,<a class = "tag" name = "tag6_56" id = "tag6_56" href =

<span class = "linenum mckay">VI. 432-460</span>
the abode, and sat on the roof of the bridal chamber. With these omens
were Progne and Tereus wedded; with these omens were they made parents.
Thrace, indeed, congratulated them, and they themselves returned thanks
to the Gods, and they commanded the day, upon which the daughter of
Pandion was given to the renowned prince, and that upon which Itys was
born, to be considered as festivals. So much does our true interest lie
concealed <i>from us</i>. Now Titan had drawn the seasons of the
repeated year through five autumns, when Progne, in gentle accents, said
to her husband, “If I have any influence <i>with thee</i>, either send
me to see my sister, or let my sister come hither. Thou shalt promise
thy father-in-law that she shall return in a short time. As good as a
mighty God <i>wilt thou be</i> to me, if thou shalt allow me to see my
sister.”</p>

<p>He <i>thereupon</i> ordered ships to be launched;<a class = "tag"
name = "tag6_57" id = "tag6_57" href = "#note6_57">57</a> and with sails
and oars he entered the Cecropian harbor, and landed upon the shores of

"#note6_58">58</a> As soon as ever an opportunity was given of
<i>addressing</i> his father-in-law, and right hand was joined to right
hand, with evil omen their discourse began. He had commenced to relate
the occasion of his coming, <i>and</i> the request of his wife, and to
promise a speedy return for <i>Philomela, if</i> sent. <i>When</i> lo!
Philomela comes, richly adorned
<span class = "pagenum bell">212</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">VI. 451-489</span>
in costly apparel; richer <i>by far</i> in her charms; such as we hear
<i>of</i> the Naiads and Dryads <i>as they</i> haunt the middle of the
forests, if you were only to give them the like ornaments and dress.
Tereus was inflamed upon seeing the virgin, no otherwise than if one
were to put fire beneath the whitening ears of corn, or were to burn
leaves and <i>dry</i> grass laid up in stacks. Her beauty, indeed, is
worthy <i>of love</i>; but inbred lust, as well, urges him on, and the
people in those regions are <i>naturally</i> much inclined to
lustfulness. He burns, both by his own frailty and that of his nation.
He has a desire
<span class = "pagenum mckay">237</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">VI. 461-492</span>
to corrupt the care of her attendants, and the fidelity of her nurse,
and <i>besides</i>, to tempt herself with large presents, and to spend
his whole kingdom <i>in so doing</i>; or else, to seize her, and, when
seized, to secure her by a cruel war. And there is nothing which, being
seized by an unbridled passion, he may not dare; nor does his breast
contain the internal flame. And now he ill bears with delay; and with
eager mouth returns to <i>urge</i> the request of Progne, and under it
he pleads his own wishes; passion makes him eloquent. As oft as he
presses beyond what <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘his’">is</ins> becoming, he pretends that Progne has thus desired. He
adds tears as well, as though she had enjoined them too. O&nbsp;ye Gods
above, how much of dark night do the breasts of mortals contain! Through
his very attempt at villany, Tereus is thought to be affectionate, and
from his crime does he gather praise.</p>

<p>And how is it, too, that Philomela desires the same thing? and fondly
embracing the shoulders of her father with her arms, she begs, even by
her own safety (and against it too), that she may visit her sister.
Tereus views her, and, while viewing her, is embracing her beforehand in
imagination; and, as he beholds her kisses, and her arms around <i>her
father’s</i> neck, he receives them all as incentives, and fuel, and the
food of his furious passion; and, as often as she embraces her father,
he could wish to be <i>that</i> father, and, even then, he would have
been not the less impious. The father is overcome by the entreaties of
them both. She rejoices, and returns thanks to her parent, and, to her
misfortune, deems that the success of both, which will be the cause of
sorrow to them both. Now but little of his toil was remaining for
Phœbus, and his steeds were beating with their feet the descending track
of Olympus; a&nbsp;regal banquet was set on the tables, and
<span class = "pagenum bell">213</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">VI. 489-521</span>
wine in golden <i>vessels</i>; after this, their bodies were given up to
gentle sleep. But the Odrysian king,<a class = "tag" name = "tag6_59" id
= "tag6_59" href = "#note6_59">59</a> though he was withdrawn, still
burned for her; and, recalling her form, her movements, her hands,
fancies that which he has not yet seen, to be such as he wishes; and he
<span class = "pagenum mckay">238</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">VI. 493-522</span>
himself feeds his own flames, his anxiety preventing sleep.</p>

<p>It was <i>now</i> day; and Pandion, grasping the right hand of his
son-in-law, about to depart, with tears bursting forth, recommended his
companion <i>to his care</i>. “I&nbsp;commit her, my dear son-in-law, to
thee, because reasons, grounded on affection, have compelled me, and
both <i>my daughters</i> have desired it, and thou as well, Tereus, hast
wished it; and I entreat thee, begging by thy honor, by thy breast
<i>thus</i> allied to us, <i>and</i> by the Gods above, to protect her
with the love of a father; and do send back to me, as soon as possible,
this sweet comfort of my anxious old age, <i>for</i> all delay will be
tedious to me, and do thou, too, Philomela, if thou hast any affection
for me, return as soon as possible: ’tis enough that thy sister is so
far away.” <i>Thus</i> did he enjoin, and at the same time he gave
kisses to his daughter, and his affectionate tears fell amid his
instructions. He <i>then</i> demanded the right hands of them both, as a
pledge of their fidelity, and joined them together when given, and bade
them, with mindful lips, to salute for him his absent daughter and
grandson, and with difficulty<a class = "tag" name = "tag6_60" id =
"tag6_60" href = "#note6_60">60</a> uttered the last farewell, his mouth
being filled with sobs; and he shuddered at the presages of his own
mind. But as soon as Philomela was put on board of the painted ship, and
the sea was urged by the oars, and the land was left behind, he
exclaimed, “I&nbsp;have gained my point; the object of my desires is
borne along with me.” The barbarian exults, too, and with difficulty
defers his joy in his intention, and turns not his eyes anywhere away
from her. No otherwise than when the ravenous bird of Jupiter, with
crooked talons, has placed a hare in his lofty nest; there is no escape
for the captive; the plunderer keeps his eye on his prey. And now the
voyage is ended, and now they have gone forth from the wearied ship,
upon his own shore; when the king drags the daughter of Pandion into a
lofty dwelling, concealed in an ancient wood,
<span class = "pagenum bell">214</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">VI. 522-559</span>
and there he shuts her up, pale and trembling, and dreading everything,
<span class = "pagenum mckay">239</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">VI. 523-555</span>
and now with tears inquiring where her sister is; and confessing his
baseness, he masters by force her a maiden, and but one, while she often
vainly calls on her father, often on her sister, and on the great Gods
above all. She trembles like a frightened lamb, which, wounded, being
snatched from the mouth of a hoary wolf, does not as yet seem to itself
in safety; and as a dove, its feathers soaked with its own blood, still
trembles, and dreads the ravening talons wherein it has been
<i>lately</i> held. <i>But</i> soon, when consciousness returned,
tearing her dishevelled hair like one mourning, and beating her arms in
lamentation, stretching out her hands, she said, “Oh, barbarous
<i>wretch</i>, for thy dreadful deeds; oh, cruel <i>monster</i>! have
neither the requests of my father, with his affectionate tears, moved
thee, nor a regard for my sister, nor my virgin state, nor the laws of
marriage? Thou hast confounded all. I&nbsp;am become the supplanter of
my sister; thou, the husband of both of us. This punishment was not my
due. Why dost thou not take away this life, that no villany, perfidious
<i>wretch</i>, may remain <i>unperpetrated</i> by thee? and would that
thou hadst done it before thy criminal embraces! <i>then</i> I might
have had a shade void of <i>all</i> crime. Yet, if the Gods above behold
these things, if the majesty of the Gods be anything; if, with myself,
all things are not come to ruin; one time or other thou shalt give me
satisfaction. I&nbsp;myself, having cast shame aside, will declare thy
deeds. If opportunity is granted me, I&nbsp;will come among the people;
if I shall be kept imprisoned in the woods, I&nbsp;will fill the woods,
and will move the conscious rocks. Let Heaven hear these things, and the
Gods, if there are any in it.”</p>

<p>After the wrath of the cruel tyrant was aroused by such words, and
his fear was not less than it, urged on by either cause, he drew the
sword, with which he was girt, from the sheath, and seizing her by the
hair, her arms being bent behind her back, he compelled her to submit to
chains. Philomela was preparing her throat, and, on seeing the sword,
had conceived hopes of her death. He cut away, with his cruel weapon,
her tongue seized with pincers, while giving vent to her indignation,
<span class = "pagenum mckay">240</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">VI. 555-585</span>
and constantly calling on the name of her father, and struggling to
speak. The extreme root of the tongue <i>still</i> quivers. <i>The
tongue</i> itself lies, and faintly murmurs, quivering upon the black
earth; and as the tail of a mangled snake is
<span class = "pagenum bell">215</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">VI. 559-586</span>
wont to writhe about, <i>so</i> does it throb, and, as it dies, seeks
the feet of its owner. It is said, too, that often after this crime
(I&nbsp;could hardly dare believe it) he satisfied his lust upon her
mutilated body.</p>

<p>He has the effrontery, after such deeds, to return to Progne, who, on
seeing her husband, inquires for her sister; but he heaves feigned
sighs, and tells a fictitious story of her death; and his tears procure
him credit. Progne tears from her shoulders her robes, shining with
broad gold, and puts on black garments, and erects an honorary
sepulchre, and offers expiation to an imaginary shade; and laments the
death of a sister not thus to be lamented.</p>

<p>The God <i>Apollo</i>, the year being completed, had run through the
twice six signs <i>of the Zodiac</i>. What can Philomela do?
A&nbsp;guard prevents her flight; the walls of the house are hard, built
of solid stone: her speechless mouth is deprived of the means of
discovering the crime. But in grief there is extreme ingenuity, and
inventive skill arises in misfortunes. She skilfully suspends the warp
in a web of Barbarian design,<a class = "tag" name = "tag6_61" id =
"tag6_61" href = "#note6_61">61</a> and interweaves purple marks with
white, as a mode of discovering the villany <i>of Tereus</i>; and
delivers it, when finished, to one <i>of her attendants</i>, and begs
her, by signs, to carry it to her mistress. As desired, she carries it
to Progne, and does not know what she is delivering in it. The wife of
the savage tyrant unfolds the web, and reads the mournful tale<a class =
"tag" name = "tag6_62" id = "tag6_62" href = "#note6_62">62</a> of her
sister, and (wondrous that she can be so!) she is silent. ’Tis grief
that stops her utterance, and words sufficiently indignant fail her
tongue, in want of them; nor is there room for weeping. But she rushes
onward, about
<span class = "pagenum mckay">241</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">VI. 586-596</span>
to confound both right and wrong, and is wholly <i>occupied</i> in the

<span class = "pagenum mckay">242</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">VI. 596-620</span>
<p>She comes at length to the lonely dwelling, and howls aloud, and
cries “Evoë!” and breaks open the gates, and seizes her sister, and puts
upon her, <i>so</i> seized, the badges of Bacchus, and conceals her
countenance under the foliage of ivy; and dragging her along, full of
amazement, leads her within her threshold. When Philomela perceives that
she has arrived at that accursed house,<a class = "tag" name = "tag6_66"
id = "tag6_66" href = "#note6_66">66</a> the wretched woman shudders,
and paleness spreads over her whole face. Progne having <i>now</i> got a

rites,<a class = "tag" name = "tag6_67" id = "tag6_67" href =
"#note6_67">67</a> and unveils the blushing face of her wretched sister;
<span class = "pagenum bell">217</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">VI. 605-641</span>
and holds her in her embraces. But she, on the other hand, cannot endure
to lift up her eyes; seeming to herself the supplanter of her sister,
and fixing her looks on the ground, her hand is in the place of voice to
her, as she desires to swear and to call the Gods to witness that this
disgrace has been brought upon her by violence. Progne burns <i>with
rage</i>, and contains not her anger; and checking the grief of her
sister, she says, “We must not act in this matter with tears, but with
the sword, <i>and even</i> with anything, if <i>such</i> thou hast, that
can possibly outdo the sword. I&nbsp;have, sister, prepared myself for
every crime! Either, when I shall have set fire to the royal palace with
torches, I&nbsp;will throw the artful Tereus into the midst of the
flames, or with the steel will I cut away his tongue or his eyes, or the
members that have deprived thee of thy chastity, or by a thousand wounds
will I expel his guilty soul <i>from his body</i>. Something tremendous
am I prepared for; what it is, I&nbsp;am still in doubt.”</p>

<p>While Progne was uttering such expressions, Itys came to his mother.
By him she was put in mind of what she might do; and looking at him with
vengeful eyes, she said, “Ah! how like thou art to thy father!” And
saying no more, she prepared for a <ins class = "corr bell" title =

rage. Yet when her son came

<span class = "linenum mckay">VI. 620-652</span>
to her, and saluted his mother and drew her neck <i>towards him</i> with
his little arms, and added kisses mingled with childish endearments, the
mother, in truth, was moved, and her anger abated, and her eyes, in
spite of her, became wet with tears <i>thus</i> forced <ins class =
"corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘{from} her’"><i>from her</i></ins>.
But soon as she found the mother <i>in her</i> shrinking from <ins class

affection, from him again did she turn towards the features of her
sister; and looking at them both by turns, she said, “Why does the one
employ endearments, <i>while</i> the other is silent with her tongue
torn from her? Why does she not call her sister, whom he calls mother?
Consider to what kind of husband thou art married, daughter of Pandion.
Thou dost grow degenerate. Tenderness in the wife of Tereus is
criminality.” No <i>more</i> delay <i>is there</i>; she drags Itys
along, just as the tigress of the banks of the Ganges <i>does</i> the
suckling offspring of the hind, through the shady forests. And when they
are come to a remote part of the lofty house, Progne strikes<a class =

the sword,

extending his hands, and as he beholds his fate, crying now “Alas!” and
now “My mother!” and clinging to her neck, where his breast joins his
side; nor does she turn away her face. Even one wound <i>alone</i> is
sufficient for his death; Philomela cuts his throat with the sword; and
they mangle his limbs, still quivering and retaining somewhat of life.
Part of them boils,<a class = "tag" name = "tag6_69" id = "tag6_69" href

inmost recesses stream with gore. His wife sets Tereus, in his
unconsciousness, before this banquet; and falsely pretending rites after
the manner of her country, at which it is allowed one man only to be
present, she removes his attendants and servants. Tereus himself,
sitting aloft on the throne of his forefathers, eats and heaps his own
entrails into his own stomach. And so great is the blindness of his
mind, <i>that</i> he says, “Send for Itys.” Progne is unable to
<span class = "pagenum mckay">244</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">VI. 653-676</span>
conceal her cruel joy; and now, desirous to be the discoverer of her
having murdered him, she says, “Thou hast within <i>thee</i>, that for
which thou art asking.” He looks around, and inquires where he is; as he
inquires, and calls him again, Philomela springs forth, just as she is,
with her hair disordered by the infernal murder, and throws the bloody
head of Itys in the face of his father; nor at any time has she more
longed to be able to speak, and to testify her joy by words such as are
deserved.</p>

desires, if he <i>only</i> can, by opening his breast to discharge
thence the horrid repast, and the half-digested entrails. And then he
weeps, and pronounces himself the wretched sepulchre of his own son; and
then he follows the daughters of Pandion with his drawn sword. You would
have thought the bodies of the Cecropian<a class = "tag" name =

the marks of murder withdrawn from her breast; and her feathers are

desire for revenge, is turned into a bird, upon whose head stands a
crested <i>plume</i>; a&nbsp;prolonged bill projects in place of the

By the symbolical changes of Philomela, Progne, and Tereus, those who
framed this termination of the story intended to depict the different
characters of the persons whose actions are there
<span class = "pagenum mckay">245</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">VI. 677</span>
represented. As the lapwing delights in filth and impurity, the ancients
thereby <ins class = "corr bell" title = "Bell reads ‘pourtrayed’">portrayed</ins> the unscrupulous character of Tereus; and,
as the flight of that bird is but slow, it shows that he was not able to
overtake his wife and her sister. The nightingale, concealed in the
woods and thickets, seems there to be concealing her misfortunes and
sorrows; and the swallow, which frequents the abodes of man, shows the
restlessness of Progne, who seeks in vain for her son, whom, in her
frantic fit, she has so barbarously murdered.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Anacreon and Apollodorus, however, reverse the story, saying that
Philomela was changed into a swallow, and Progne into a nightingale.
This event is said by some writers to have happened not in Thrace, but
at Daulis, a&nbsp;town of Phocis, where Tereus is supposed to have gone
to settle. Pausanias tells us, that the tomb of Tereus was to be seen
near Athens, so that it is probable that he died at a distance from
Thrace, his native country. Homer alludes to the story of Philomela in
somewhat different terms; speaking of the grounds of the grief of
Penelope, he says, that ‘she made her complaints to be heard like the
inconsolable Philomela, the daughter of Pandarus, always hidden among
the leaves and branches of trees. When the Spring arrives, she makes her
voice echo through the woods, and laments her dear Itylus, whom she
killed by an unhappy mistake; varying, in her continued plaints, the
mournful melody of her notes.’ By this, Homer seems to have known
nothing of Tereus or of Progne, and to have followed a tradition, which
was to the following effect:&mdash;Pandarus had three daughters, Ædon,
Mecrope, and Cleothera. Ædon, the eldest, was married to Zethus, the
brother of Amphion, by whom she had one son, who was named Itylus.
Envying the more numerous family of Niobe, her sister-in-law, she
resolved to despatch the eldest of her nephews; and, as her son was
brought up with his cousin, and was his bedfellow, she bade him change
his place in the bed, on the night on which she intended to commit the
crime. Itylus forgot her commands, and consequently his mother killed
him by mistake for her nephew.</p>

terrible with that rage which is his wont, and but too natural with that

Plato tells us that the story of the rape of Orithyïa is but an
allegory, which signifies that, by accident, she was blown by the wind
into the sea, where she was drowned. Apollodorus and Pausanias, however,
assert that this story is based on historical facts, and that Boreas,
king of Thrace, seized Orithyïa, the daughter of Erectheus, king of
Athens, and sister of Procris, as she was passing the river Ilissus, and
carried her into his dominions, where she became the mother of twins,
Calaïs and Zethes. In the Argonautic expedition, these chiefs delivered
Phineus, the king of Bithynia, from the persecution of the Harpies,
which were in the habit of snatching away the victuals served up at his
table.</p>

this queen of the Pigmies was Gerane, while other writers call her
Pygas. She was worshipped by her subjects as a Goddess, which raised her
to such a degree of conceit, that she despised the worship of the
Deities, especially of Juno and Diana, on which in their indignation,
they changed her into a crane, the most active enemy of the Pygmies.
These people were dwarfs, living either in India, Arabia, or Thrace, and
they were said not to exceed a cubit in height.</p>

Myrrha), remarkable for their extreme beauty. Growing insolent upon the
strength of their good looks, and pretending to surpass even Juno
herself in beauty, they incurred the resentment of that Goddess, who
changed them into the steps of a temple, and transformed their father

<i>How Saturn.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 126. By Phillyra, Saturn was the father
of the Centaur Chiron. We may here remark, that Arachne was not very
complimentary to the Gods, in the choice of her subjects; probably it
was not her intention or wish to be so.</p>

which Latona fled from the serpent Python, which Juno, in her jealousy,
had sent against her; and when Delos, which had hitherto been a floating
island, became immovable, for the convenience of Latona, in labor with
Apollo and Diana. That island was said to have received its name from
the Greek, <span class = "greek" title = "dêlos">δῆλος</span>,
‘manifest,’ or ‘appearing,’ from having risen to the surface of the sea
on that occasion.</p>

<i>Glowing with oil.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 241. Clarke renders this line,
‘Were gone to the juvenile work of neat wrestling.’ It would be hard to
say what ‘neat’ wrestling is. He seems not to have known, that the
‘Palæstra’ was called ‘nitida,’ as shining with the oil which the
wrestlers used for making their limbs supple, and the more difficult for
their antagonist to grasp. Juvenal gives the epithet ‘ceromaticum’ to
the neck of the athlete, or wrestler, which word means ‘rubbed with
wrestler’s oil.’</p>

<i>I have received my death-blow.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 283. ‘Efferor’

signify the carrying of the body out of the city walls, for the purposes
of burial.</p>

<p>

<i>Before the biers.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 289. The body of the deceased
person was in ancient times laid out on a bed of the ordinary kind, with
a pillow for supporting the head and back; among the Romans, it was
placed in the vestibule of the house, with its feet towards the door,
and was dressed in the best robe which the deceased had worn when alive.
Among the better classes, the body was borne to the place of burial, or
the funeral pile, on a couch, which was called ‘feretrum,’ or ‘capulus.’
This was sometimes made of ivory, and covered with gold and purple.</p>

Bœotia, which, as we learn from Pausanias, had on its summit a rock,
which, at a distance, strongly resembled a female in an attitude of
sorrow. This resemblance is said to exist even at the present day.</p>

<p>

<i>The Chimæra.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 339. The Chimæra, according to the
poets, was a monster having the head of a lion, the body of a goat, and
the tail of a dragon. It seems, however, that it was nothing more than a
volcanic mountain of Lycia, in Asia Minor, whence there were occasional
eruptions of flame. The top of it was frequented by lions; the middle
afforded plentiful pasture for goats; and towards the bottom, being
rocky, and full of caverns, it was infested by vast numbers of serpents,
that harbored there.</p>

<i>Beheld a lake.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 343. Probus, in his Commentary on the
Second Book of the Georgics, says that the name of the spring was Mela,
and that of the shepherd who so churlishly repulsed Latona, was Neocles.
Antoninus Liberalis says, that the name of the stream was Melites, and
that Latona required the water for the purpose of bathing her children.
He further tells us, that on being repulsed, she carried her children to
the river Xanthus, and returning thence, hurled stones at the peasants,
and changed them into frogs.</p>

<i>Beneath the water.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 376. Some commentators are so
fanciful as to say, that the repetition of the words ‘sub aqua,’ in the
line ‘Quamvis sint sub aquâ, sub aquâ, maledicere tentant,’ not
inelegantly [non ineleganter] expresses the croaking noise of the frogs.
A&nbsp;man’s fancy must, indeed, be exuberant to find any such
resemblance; more so, indeed, than that of Aristophanes, who makes his
frogs say, by way of chorus, ‘<ins class = "corr both" title = "text unchanged: one ‘-ke-’ too many">brekekekekex</ins> koäx koäx.’ Possibly,
however, that might have been the Attic dialect among frogs.</p>

pine-tree, or, according to Pliny the Elder, a&nbsp;plane-tree, which
was to be seen even in his day. The skin was afterwards suspended by
Apollo in the city of Celenæ. Hyginus says, that Apollo hewed Marsyas to
pieces. The description here of the flaying is, perhaps, very natural;
but it is all the more disgusting for being so. A&nbsp;commentator
justly says, that it might suit a Roman, whose eyes were familiar with

<i>Olympus.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 393. He was a Satyr, the brother and pupil
of Marsyas. Pausanias describes a picture, painted by Polygnotus, in
which Olympus was represented as sitting by Marsyas, clad as a youth,
and learning to play on the flute. Euripides, in the Iphigenia in Aulis
(l. 576) says that Olympus discovered some new measures for the ‘tibia,’
or flute. From Hyginus we learn, that Apollo delivered to him the body
of Marsyas for burial.</p>

<i>Calydon.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 415. This was a city of Ætolia, which
derived its name from Calydon, the son of Endymion. Diana, being
incensed against Œneus, its king, because he omitted her when offering
the first fruits to the other Deities, sent an immense boar to ravage
its fields, which was slain by Meleager. Ovid recounts these
circumstances in the eighth book of the Metamorphoses. Argos, Sparta,
and Mycenæ, are also included in one line, by Homer, as having been
under the particular tutelage of Juno.</p>

<i>Famous for its brass.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 416. According to some writers,
the Corinthian brass became famous after the fall of Corinth, when it
was taken and burnt by the Consul Mummius. On that occasion, they say,
that from the immense number of statues melted in the conflagration,
a&nbsp;stream of metal poured through the streets, consisting of melted
gold, silver, and copper; in which, of course, the latter would be
predominant. If that was the ground on which the Corinthian brass was so
much commended, Ovid is here guilty of an anachronism.</p>

Achaia.</p>

<i>Erectheus.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 677. This personage really was king of
Athens before Pandion, the father of Progne and Philomela, and not after
him, as Ovid here states; at least, such is the account given by
Pausanias and Eusebius: the order of succession being Actæus, Cecrops,
Cranaüs, Amphictyon, Erecthonius, Pandion, Erectheus, Cecrops II.,
Pandion II., Ægeus, Theseus.</p>

part of the sea had not been navigated before; though many of the poets
assert that the Argo was the first ship that was ever built. It is more
probable that it was the first vessel that was ever fitted out as a ship
of war.</p>

violent flame; and having long struggled <i>against it</i>, after she is
unable to conquer her frenzy by reason, she says: “In vain, Medea, dost
thou resist; some God, who, I&nbsp;know not, is opposing thee. It is a
wonder too, if it is not this, or at least something like this, which is
called ‘love.’ For why do the commands
<span class = "pagenum mckay">249</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">VII. 15-44</span>
of my father appear too rigid for me? and yet too rigid they are. Why
<span class = "pagenum bell">223</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">VII. 16-48</span>
am I in dread, lest he whom I have seen <i>but</i> so lately, should
perish? What is the cause of alarm so great? Banish the flames conceived
in thy virgin breast, if thou canst, unhappy <i>creature</i>. If I
could, I&nbsp;would be more rational. But a new power draws me on,
against my will; and Cupid persuades one thing, reason another.
I&nbsp;see which is the more proper <i>course</i>, and I approve of it,
<i>while</i> I follow the wrong one. Why, royal maiden, art thou burning
for a stranger, and why coveting the nuptial ties of a strange country?
This land, too, may give thee something which thou mayst love. Whether
he shall live, or whether die, is in <i>the disposal of</i> the Gods.
Yet he may survive; and that I may pray for, even without love. For what
<i>fault</i> has Jason committed? Whom, but one of hard heart, would not
the <i>youthful</i> age of Jason affect? his descent too, and his valor?
Whom, though these other points were wanting, would not his beauty move?
at least, he has moved my breast. But unless I shall give him aid, he
will be breathed upon by the mouths of the bulls; and will engage with
his own <i>kindred</i> crops, an enemy sprung from the earth; or he will
be given as a cruel prey to the ravenous dragon. If I allow this, then I
will confess that I was born of a tigress; then, <i>too</i>, that I
carry steel and stone in my heart. Why do I not as well behold him
perish? Why not, too, profane my eyes by seeing it? Why do I not
stimulate the bulls against him, and the fierce sons of the earth, and
the never-sleeping dragon? May the Gods award better things. And yet
these things are not to be prayed for, but must be effected by myself.
Shall I <i>then</i> betray the kingdom of my father? and by my aid shall
some stranger, I&nbsp;know not who, be saved; that being delivered by my
means, he may spread his sails to the winds without me, and be the
husband of another; and&nbsp;I, Medea, be left for punishment? If he can
do this, and if he is capable of preferring another to me, let him
perish in his ingratitude. But not such is his countenance, not such
that nobleness of soul, that gracefulness of person, that I should fear
treachery, and forgetfulness

<p><i>Thus</i> she said, and before her eyes stood Virtue, Affection,
and Modesty; and now Cupid turned his vanquished back. She was going to
the ancient altars of Hecate,<a class = "tag" name = "tag7_12" id =
"tag7_12" href = "#note7_12">12</a> the daughter of Perses, which a
shady grove and the recesses of a wood concealed. And now she was
resolved, and her passion being checked, had subsided; when she beheld
the son of Æson, and the extinguished flame revived. Her cheeks were
covered with blushes, and her whole face was suffused with a glow. As a
spark is wont to derive nourishment from the winds, which, but small
when it lay concealed beneath the ashes cast over it, <ins class = "corr
mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘is {wont}’"><i>is wont</i></ins> to
increase, and aroused, to rise again to its original strength, so her
love, now declining, which you would suppose was now growing languid,
when she beheld the youth, was rekindled with the appearance of him
before her eyes. And by chance, on that day, the son of Æson was more
<span class = "pagenum mckay">252</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">VII. 85-110</span>
beauteous than usual. You might forgive her loving him. She gazes; and
keeps her eyes fixed upon his countenance, as though but now seen for
the first time; and in her frenzy she thinks she does not behold the
face of a mortal; nor does she turn away from him. But when the stranger
began to speak, and seized her right hand, and begged her assistance
with a humble voice, and promised her marriage; she said, with tears
running down, “I&nbsp;see what I ought to do; and it will not be
ignorance of the truth, but love that beguiles me. By my agency thou
shalt be saved; when saved, grant what thou hast promised.”</p>

father-in-law, who beholds all things, and by his own adventures, and by
dangers so great. Being believed <i>by her</i>, he immediately received
some enchanted herbs, and thoroughly learned the use of them, and went
away rejoicing to his abode. The next morning had <i>now</i> dispersed
the twinkling stars, <i>when</i> the people repaired to the sacred field
of Mavors, and ranged themselves on the hills. In the midst of the
assembly sat the king himself, arrayed in purple, and distinguished by a
sceptre of ivory. Behold! the brazen-footed bulls breathe forth flames<a
class = "tag" name = "tag7_14" id = "tag7_14" href = "#note7_14">14</a>
from their adamantine nostrils; and the grass touched by the vapors is
on fire. And as the forges filled <i>with fire</i> are wont to roar, or
when flints<a class = "tag" name = "tag7_15" id = "tag7_15" href =
"#note7_15">15</a> dissolved in an earthen furnace receive intense heat
by the sprinkling of flowing water; so do their breasts rolling forth
the flames enclosed within, and their scorched throats, resound.
<span class = "pagenum mckay">253</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">VII. 110-139</span>
Yet the son of Æson goes forth to meet them. The fierce <i>bulls</i>
turn their terrible features, and their horns pointed with iron, towards
his face as he advances, and with cloven hoofs they spurn the dusty
ground, and fill the place with lowings, that send forth clouds of
smoke. The Minyæ are frozen with horror. He comes up, and feels not the
flames breathed forth by them, so great is the power of the
incantations. He even strokes their hanging dewlaps with a bold right
hand, and, subjected to the yoke, he obliges them to draw the heavy
weight of a plough, and to turn up with the share the plain <i>till
now</i> unused to it.<a class = "tag" name = "tag7_16" id = "tag7_16"
href = "#note7_16">16</a></p>

<p>The Colchians are astonished; the Minyæ fill <i>the air</i> with
their shouts, and give him <i>fresh</i> courage. Then in a brazen
<span class = "pagenum bell">227</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">VII. 120-155</span>
helmet he takes the dragon’s teeth,<a class = "tag" name = "tag7_17" id
= "tag7_17" href = "#note7_17">17</a> and strews them over the ploughed
up fields. The ground, impregnated beforehand with a potent drug,
softens the seed; and the teeth that were sown grow up, and become new
bodies. And as the infant receives the human form in the womb of the
mother, and is there formed in all its parts, and comes not forth into
the common air until at maturity, so when the figure of man is ripened
in the bowels of the pregnant earth, it arises in the fruitful plain;
and, what is still more surprising, it brandishes arms produced at the
same time. When the Pelasgians saw them preparing to hurl their spears
with sharp points at the head of the Hæmonian youth, they lowered their
countenances and their courage, <i>quailing</i> with fear. She, too,
became alarmed, who had rendered him secure; and when she saw the youth,
being but one, attacked by so many enemies, she turned pale, and
suddenly chilled <i>with fear</i>, sat down without blood <i>in her
cheeks</i>. And, lest the herbs that had been given by her, should avail
him but little, she repeats an auxiliary charm, and summons <i>to her
aid</i> her secret arts. He, hurling a heavy stone into the midst of his
<span class = "pagenum mckay">254</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">VII. 140-158</span>
enemies, turns the warfare, now averted from himself, upon themselves.
The Earth-born brothers perish by mutual wounds, and fall in civil
fight. The Greeks congratulate him, and caress the conqueror, and cling
to him in hearty embraces. And thou too, barbarian maiden, wouldst fain
have embraced him; ’twas modesty that opposed the design; otherwise thou
wouldst have embraced him; but regard for thy reputation restrained thee
from doing so. What thou mayst do, <i>thou dost do</i>; thou rejoicest
with a silent affection, and thou givest thanks to thy charms, and to
the Gods, the authors of them.</p>

<p>It <i>still</i> remains to lay asleep with herbs the watchful dragon,
who, distinguished by his crest and his three tongues, and terrible with
his hooked teeth, is the keeper of the Golden Fleece. After he has
sprinkled him with herbs of Lethæan juice,<a class = "tag" name =

sons, Learchus and Melicerta. Ino, hating the children of Nephele,
sought to destroy them. Phryxus being informed thereof, ordered a ship
to be privately prepared; and taking his father’s treasures, sailed with
<span class = "pagenum mckay">255</span>
his sister Helle, to seek a retreat in the court of Æetes, his kinsman.
Helle died on the voyage, but Phryxus arrived in Colchis, where he
dedicated the prow of his ship to Neptune, or Jupiter. He there married
Chalciope, by whom he had four sons, Argos, Phrontes, Molas, and
Cylindus. Some years after, Æetes caused him to be assassinated; and his
sons fleeing to the court of their grandfather, Athamas, were
shipwrecked on an island, where they remained until found there by
Jason, who took them back to their mother. Having mourned them as dead,
she was transported with joy on finding them, and used every exertion to
aid Jason in promoting his addresses to Medea. Æetes having seized the
treasures of Athamas on the death of Phryxus, the Greeks prepared an
expedition to recover them, and to avenge his death. Pelias, who had
driven his brother Æson from the throne of Iolcos, desiring to procure
the absence of his son Jason, took this opportunity of engaging him in
an enterprise, which promised both glory, profit, and a large amount of
personal exertion. The uneasiness which Pelias felt was caused by the
prediction of an oracle, that he should be killed by a prince of the
family of Æolus, and which warned him to beware of a person who should
have but one shoe. Just at that period, Jason, returning from the school
of Chiron, lost one of his shoes in crossing a river. On this, his uncle
was desirous to destroy him; but not daring to do so publicly, he
induced him to embark with the Argonauts, expecting that he would perish
in an undertaking of so perilous a nature. Many young nobles of Greece
repaired to the court of Iolcos, and joined in the undertaking, when
they chose Jason for their leader, and embarked in a ship, the name of
which was Argo, and from which the adventurers received the name of
Argonauts.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Diodorus Siculus says, that the ship was so named from its swiftness;
<span class = "pagenum bell">229</span>
while others say, that it was so called from Argus, the name of its
builder, or from the Argives, or Greeks, on board of it. Bochart,
however, supposes, that the name is derived from the Phœnician word
‘arco,’ which signifies ‘long,’ and suggests, that before that time the
Greeks sailed in vessels of a rounder form, Jason being the first who
sailed in a ship built in the form of a galley. After many adventures,
on arriving at the Isle of Lemnos, they found that the women had killed
their husbands in a fit of jealousy, on which the Argonauts took wives
from their number, and Jason received for his companion Hypsipyle, the
daughter of Thoas. Putting to sea again, they were driven on the coast
of Bithynia, where they delivered Phineus, its king, from the
persecution of the Harpies, who were in the habit of snatching away the
victuals from his table. These monsters, of hideous form, with crooked
beaks and talons, huge wings, and the faces of women, the Argonauts, and
especially Calais and Zethes, pursued as far as the islands called
Strophades, in the Ionian sea, where Iris appearing to them, enjoined
them to pursue the Harpies no further, promising that Phineus should no
longer be persecuted by them. To explain this story, some suppose that
the Harpies were the daughters of Phineus, who by their dissipation and
extravagance, had ruined him in his old age, which occasioned the
saying, that they snatched the victuals out of his mouth. Le&nbsp;Clerc
thinks, that the Harpies were vast swarms of grasshoppers, which ravaged
<span class = "pagenum mckay">256</span>
all Paphlagonia, and caused a famine in the dominions of Phineus; the
word ‘arbati,’ whence the term ‘Harpy’ is derived, signifying ‘a
grasshopper;’ and that the North wind blowing them into the Ionian sea,
it gave rise to the saying, that the sons of Boreas pursued them so far.
Diodorus Siculus does not mention the Harpies, though he speaks of the
arrival of the Argonauts at the court of Phineus.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
After some other adventures, the Argonauts arrived at Colchis. Æetes, or
Æeta, the king, having been forewarned by an oracle, that a stranger
should deprive him of his crown and life, had established a custom of
sacrificing all strangers found in his dominions. His daughter Medea,
falling in love with Jason, promised him her assistance in preserving
them from the dangers to which they were exposed, on the condition of
his marrying her. Having engaged to do so, she conducted him by night to
the royal palace, and gave him a false key, by means whereof he found
the royal treasures, and carrying them off, embarked with Medea and his
companions. By way of explaining the miraculous portion of the story, we
may, perhaps, not err in supposing, that the account of it was
originally written in the Phœnician language; and through not
understanding it, the Greeks invented the fiction of the Fleece, the
Dragon, and the Fiery Bulls. Bochart and Le&nbsp;Clerc have observed,
that the Syriac word ‘gaza,’ signifies either ‘a treasure,’ or ‘a
fleece.’ ‘Saur,’ which means ‘a wall,’ also means ‘a bull;’ and in the
same language the same word, ‘nachas,’ signifies both ‘brass,’ ‘iron,’
and ‘a dragon.’ Hence, instead of the simple narrative, that Jason, by
the aid of Medea, carried away the treasures which Æetes kept within
walls, with bolts, or locks of metal, and which Phryxus had carried to
Colchis in a ship with the figure of a ram at the prow, it was
published, and circulated by the ignorant, that the Gods, to save
Phryxus from his stepmother, sent him a sheep with a golden fleece,
<span class = "pagenum bell">230</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">VII. 159-176</span>
which bore him to Colchis; that its fleece became the object of the
ambition of the leading men of Greece; and that whoever wished to bear
it away was obliged to contend with bulls and dragons. Some historians,
by way of interpreting the story, affirm, that the keeper of the
treasures was named ‘Draco,’ or ‘Dragon,’ and that the garrison of the
stronghold of Æetes was brought from the ‘Tauric’ Chersonesus. They say
also, that the fleece was the skin of the sheep which Phryxus had
sacrificed to Neptune, which he had caused to be gilt. It is not,
however, very likely, that an object so trifling could have excited the
avarice of the Greeks, and caused them to undertake an expedition
accompanied with so many dangers. The dragon’s teeth most probably bear
reference to some foreign troops which Jason, in the same way as Cadmus
had done, found means to alienate from Æetes, and to bring over to his
own side. Homer makes but very slight allusion to the adventures of the
Argonauts.</p>

she stirs them all up, and blends the lowest <i>ingredients</i> with the

daughters receive her; whom, after a short time, the crafty Colchian
engages to herself by the appearance of a pretended friendship. And
while among the greatest of her merits, she relates that the infirmities
of Æson have been removed, and is dwelling upon that part <i>of the
story</i>, a&nbsp;hope is suggested to the damsels, the daughters of
Pelias, that by the like art their parent may become young again; and
this they request <i>of her</i>, and repeatedly entreat her to name her
own price. For a short time she is silent, and appears to be hesitating,
and keeps their mind in suspense, as they ask, with an affected
gravity.</p>

<p>Afterwards, when she has promised them, she says, “That there may be
the greater confidence in this my skill, the leader of the flock among
your sheep, which is the most advanced in age, shall become a lamb by
this preparation.” Immediately, a&nbsp;fleecy <i>ram</i>, enfeebled by
innumerable years, is brought, with his horns bending around his hollow
temples; whose withered throat, when she has cut with the Hæmonian
knife, and stained the steel with its scanty blood, the enchantress
plunges the limbs of the sheep, and her potent juices together, into the
hollow copper. The limbs of

with his horns; and in the midst of the kettle a low bleating is heard.
And without any delay, while they are wondering at the bleating,
a&nbsp;lamb springs forth, and gambols in its course, and seeks the
suckling dugs. The daughters of Pelias are amazed; and after her
promises have obtained her credit, then, indeed, they urge her still
more strongly. Phœbus had thrice taken the yoke off his horses sinking
in the Iberian sea;<a class = "tag" name = "tag7_45" id = "tag7_45" href

being relaxed, had seized the king, and the guards together with <ins

enchanting tongue had caused. The daughters <i>of the king</i>,
<i>as</i> ordered, had entered the threshold, together with the
Colchian, and had surrounded the bed; “Why do you hesitate now, in your
indolence? Unsheathe your swords,” says she, “and exhaust the ancient
gore, that I may replenish his empty veins with youthful blood. The life
and the age of your father is now in your power. If you have any
affection and cherish not vain hopes, perform your duty to your father,
and drive away old age with your weapons, and, thrusting in the steel,
let out his corrupted blood.”</p>

<p>Upon this exhortation, as each of them is affectionate, she becomes
especially undutiful, and that she may not be wicked, she commits
wickedness. Yet not one is able to look upon her own blow; and <ins

The authors who have endeavored to explain the true meaning and origin
of the story of the restitution of Æson to youth, are much divided in
their opinions concerning it. Some think it refers to the mystery of
reviving the decrepit and aged by the transfusion of youthful blood. It
is, however, not improbable, that Medea obtained the reputation of being
a sorceress, only because she had been taught by her mother the virtues
of various plants: and that she administered a potion to Æson, which
furnished him with new spirits and strength.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Jason being reconciled to the children of Pelias, gave the crown to his
son Acastus. Becoming tired of Medea, he married Glauce, or Creüsa, the
daughter of Creon, king of Corinth. Medea, hastening to that place, left
her two sons in the temple of Juno, and set fire to Creon’s palace,
where he and
<span class = "pagenum bell">242</span>
his daughter were consumed to ashes, after which she killed her own
children. Euripides, in his tragedy of Medea, makes a chorus of
Corinthian women say, that the Corinthians themselves committed the
murder, and that the Gods sent a plague on the city, as a punishment for
the deed. Pausanias also says, that the tomb of Medea’s children, whom
the Corinthians stoned to death, was still to be seen in his time; and
that the Corinthians offered sacrifices there every year, to appease
their ghosts, as the oracle had commanded them.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Apollodorus relates this story in a different manner. He says, that
Medea sent her rival a crown, dipped in a sort of gum of a combustible
nature; and that when Glauce had put it on her head, it began to burn so
furiously, that the young princess perished <ins class = "corr mckay"
title = "McKay reads ‘in / in’ at line break">in</ins> the greatest
misery. Medea afterwards retired to Thebes, where Hercules engaged to
give her assistance against Jason, which promise, however, he failed to
perform. Going thence to Athens, she married Ægeus.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The story of her winged dragons may, perhaps, be based on the fact, that
her ship was called ‘the Dragon.’ In recounting the particulars of her
flight, Ovid makes allusion to several stories by the way, the most of
which are entirely unknown to us. With regard
<span class = "pagenum mckay">270</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">VII. 402-408</span>
to these fictions, it may not be out of place to remark here, as
affording a key to many of them, that where a person escaped from any
imminent danger, it was published that he had been changed into a bird.
If, to avoid pursuit, a&nbsp;person hid himself in a cave, he was said
to be transformed into a serpent; and if he burst into tears, from
excess of grief, he was reported to have changed into a fountain; while,
if a damsel lost herself in a wood, she became a Nymph, or a Dryad. The
resemblance of names, also, gave rise to several fictions: thus, Alopis
was changed into a fox; Cygnus into a swan; Coronis into a crow; and
Cerambus into a horned beetle. As some few of the stories here alluded
to by Ovid, refer to historical events, it may be remarked, that the
<ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘accounts’">account</ins>
of the women of Cos being changed into cows, is thought by some to have
been founded on the cruel act of the companions of Hercules, who
sacrificed some of them to the Gods of the country. The inhabitants of
the Isle of Rhodes were said to have been changed into rocks, because
they perished in an inundation, which laid a part of that island under
water, and particularly the town of Ialysus. The fruitfulness of the
daughter of Alcidamas occasioned it to be said, that she was changed
into a dove. The rage of Mæra is shown by her transformation into a
bitch; and Arne was changed into a daw, because, having sold her
country, her avarice was well depicted under the symbol of that bird,
which, according to the popular opinion, is fond of money. Phillyra, the
mother of the Centaur Chiron, was said to be changed into a linden-tree,
probably because she happened to bear the name of that tree, which in
the Greek language is called <span class = "greek" title =

about to drink, snatches away the cup from him, while Medea flies in her

the day and the shining rays <i>of the Sun</i>, in chains formed of
adamant; he, filled with furious rage, filled the air with triple
barkings at the same moment, and sprinkled the verdant fields with white

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
If it is the fact, as many antiquarians suppose, that much of the
Grecian mythology was derived from that of the Egyptians, there can be
but little doubt that their system of the Elysian Fields and the
Infernal Regions was derived from the Egyptian notions on the future
state of <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘man,’">man.</ins> The story too, of Cerberus is, perhaps, based upon
the custom of the Egyptians, who kept dogs to guard the fields or
caverns in which they kept their mummies.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
It is, however, very possible that the story of Cerberus may have been
founded upon a fact, or what was believed to be such. There was a
serpent which haunted the cavern of Tænarus, in Laconia, and ravaged the
districts adjacent to that promontory. This cave, being generally
considered to be one of the avenues to the kingdom of Pluto, the poets
thence derived the notion that this serpent was the guardian of its
portals. Pausanias observes, that Homer was the first who said that
Cerberus was a dog; though, in reality, he was a serpent, whose name in
the Greek language signified ‘one that devours flesh.’ The story that
Cerberus, with his foam, poisoned the herbs that grew in Thessaly, and
that the aconite and other poisonous plants were ever after common
there, is probably based on the simple fact, that those herbs were found
in great quantities in that region.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Women, using these herbs in their pretended enchantments, gave ground
for the stories of the witches of Thessaly, and of their ability to
bring the 
<span class = "pagenum bell">247</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">VII. 469-481</span>
moon down to the earth by their spells and incantations; which latter
notion was probably based on the circumstance, that these women used to
invoke the Night and the Moon as witnesses of their magical
operations.</p>

baffled. At first the heaven encompassed the earth with a thick
darkness, and enclosed within its clouds a drowsy heat. And while the
Moon was four times filling her orb by joining her horns, <i>and</i>,
four times decreasing, was diminishing her full orb, the hot South winds
were blowing with their deadly blasts. It is known for a fact that the
infection came even into fountains and lakes, and that many thousands of
serpents were wandering over the uncultivated fields, and were tainting
the rivers with their venom. The violence of this sudden distemper was
first discovered by the destruction of dogs, and birds, and sheep, and
oxen, and among the wild beasts.

administer remedies; and <i>their own</i> arts become an injury to their

Minos (most probably the second prince that bore that name), upon his
accession to the throne, after the death of his father, Lycastus, made
several conquests in the islands adjoining Crete, where he reigned, and,
at last, became master of those seas. The strength of his fleet is
particularly remarked by Thucydides, Apollodorus, and Diodorus
Siculus.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The Feast of the Panathenæa being celebrated at Athens, Minos sent his
son Androgeus to it, who joined as a combatant in the games, and was
sufficiently skilful to win all the prizes. The glory which he thereby
acquired, combined with his polished manners, obtained him the
friendship of the sons of Pallas, the brother of Ægeus. This
circumstance caused Ægeus to entertain jealous feelings, the more
especially as he knew that his nephews were conspiring against him.
Being informed that Androgeus was about to take a journey to Thebes, he
caused him to be assassinated near Œnoë, a&nbsp;town on the confines of
Attica. Apollodorus, indeed, says that he was killed by the Bull of
Marathon, which was then making great ravages in Greece; but it is very
possible that the Athenians encouraged this belief, with the view of
screening their king from the infamy of an action so inhuman and unjust.
<span class = "pagenum mckay">281</span>

Diodorus Siculus and Plutarch agree in stating that Ægeus himself caused
Androgeus to be murdered.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
On hearing the news of his son’s death, Minos resolved on revenge. He
ordered a strong fleet to be fitted out, and went in person to several
courts, to contract alliances, and engage other powers to assist him;
and this, with the history of the plague at Ægina, forms the subject of
the present narrative.</p>

covered with wide-spreading boughs. Here we beheld some ants, the
gatherers of corn, in a long train, carrying a heavy burden in their
little mouths, and keeping their track in the wrinkled bark. While I was
wondering at their numbers, I&nbsp;said, ‘Do thou, most gracious Father,
give me citizens as many in number, and replenish my empty walls.’ The
lofty oak trembled, and made a noise in its boughs, moving without a
breeze. My limbs quivered, with trembling fear, and my hair stood on an
end; yet I gave kisses to the earth and to the oak, nor did I confess
that I had any

mind. Night came on, and sleep seized my body wearied with anxiety.
Before my eyes the same oak seemed to be present, and to bear as many
branches, and as many animals in its branches, and to be trembling with
a similar motion, and to be scattering the grain-bearing troop on the
fields below. These suddenly grew, and seemed greater and greater, and
raised themselves from the ground, and stood with their bodies upright;
and laid aside their leanness, and the <i>former</i> number of their
feet, and their sable hue, and assumed in their limbs the human
shape.</p>

the subjects of Æacus into woods and caverns, whence they returned, when
the contagion had ceased with which their country had been afflicted,
and when he had nearly lost all hopes of seeing them again. It is
probable that the old men were carried off by the plague, while the
young, who had more strength, resisted its power, which circumstance
would fully account for the active habits of the remaining subjects of
Æacus. Some writers, however, suppose that the Myrmidons were a
barbarous, but industrious people of Thessaly, who usually dwelt in
caves, and who were brought thence by Æacus to people his island, which
had been made desolate by a pestilence. The similarity of their name to
the Greek word <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads μύρμης ‘murmês’ for ‘murmêx’">μύρμηξ</ins>, signifying ‘an ant,’ most probably

<p>Having first spoken a few words in promiscuous conversation,
<span class = "pagenum mckay">284</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">VII. 675-702</span>
he said, “I am fond of the forests, and of the chase of wild beasts;
still, from what wood the shaft of the javelin, which thou art holding,
is cut, I&nbsp;have been for some time in doubt; certainly, if it were
of wild ash, it would be of brown color; if of cornel-wood, there would
be knots in it. Whence it comes I am ignorant, but my eyes have not
looked upon a weapon used for a javelin, more beautiful than this.” One
of the Athenian brothers replied, and said, “In it, thou wilt admire its
utility, <i>even</i> more than its beauty. Whatever it is aimed at, it
strikes; chance does not guide it when thrown, and it flies back stained
with blood, no one returning it.” Then, indeed, does the Nereian youth<a

value? What he asks, <i>Cephalus</i> tells him; but as to what he is
ashamed to tell, <i>and</i> on what condition he received it, he is
silent; and, being touched with sorrow for the loss of his wife, he thus
speaks, with tears bursting forth: “Son of a Goddess, this weapon (who
could have believed it?) makes me weep, and long will make me do so, if
the Fates shall grant me long to live. ’Twas this that proved the
destruction of me and of my dear wife. Would that I had ever been
without this present! Procris was (if perchance <i>the fame of</i>

face and the manners of the two, she was the more worthy to be carried
off. Her father Erectheus united her to me; love, <i>too</i>, united her
to me. I&nbsp;was pronounced happy, and <i>so</i> I was. Not thus did it
seem <i>good</i> to the Gods; or even now, perhaps, I&nbsp;should be
<i>so</i>. The second month was now passing, after the marriage rites,
when the saffron-colored Aurora, dispelling the darkness in the morn,
beheld me, as I was planting nets for the horned deer, from

though she is comely with her rosy face, <i>and</i> though she possesses
the confines of light, and possesses <i>the confines</i> of darkness,
though she is nourished with the draughts of nectar, <i>still</i> I
loved Procris; Procris was <i>ever</i> in my thoughts, Procris was ever
on my lips. I&nbsp;alleged the sacred ties of marriage, our late
embraces, and our recent union, and the prior engagements of my forsaken
bed. The Goddess was provoked, and said, ‘Cease thy complaints,
ungrateful man; keep thy Procris; but, if my mind is gifted with
foresight, thou wilt wish that thou hadst not had her;’” and
<i>thus</i>, in anger, she sent me back to her.</p>

<p>“While I was returning, and was revolving the sayings of the Goddess
within myself, there began to be apprehensions that my wife had not duly
observed the laws of wedlock. Both her beauty and her age bade me be
apprehensive of her infidelity; <i>yet</i> her virtue forbade me to
believe it. But yet, I&nbsp;had been absent; and besides, she, from whom
I was <i>just</i> returning, was an example of <i>such</i> criminality:
but we that are in love, apprehend all <i>mishaps</i>.
I&nbsp;<i>then</i> endeavored to discover that, by reason of which I
must feel anguish, and by bribes to make attempts<a class = "tag" name =

constancy. Aurora encouraged this apprehension, and changed my shape,
<i>as</i> I seemed <i>then</i> to perceive. I&nbsp;entered Athens, the
city of Pallas, unknown <i>to any one</i>, and I went into my own house.
The house itself was without fault, and gave indications of chastity,
and was in concern for the carrying off of its master.</p>

<p>“Having, with difficulty, made my way to the daughter of Erectheus by
means of a thousand artifices, soon as I beheld her, I&nbsp;was amazed,
and was nearly abandoning my projected trial of her constancy; with
<span class = "pagenum mckay">286</span>

one could be more beautiful
<span class = "pagenum bell">257</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">VII. 732-756</span>
than she, <i>even</i> in her sadness; and she was consuming with regret
for her husband, torn from her. <i>Only</i> think, Phocus, how great was
the beauty of her, whom even sorrow did so much become. Why should I
tell how often her chaste manners repulsed <i>all</i> my attempts? How
often she said, ‘I am reserved for <i>but</i> one, wherever he is; for
that one do I reserve my joys.’ For whom, in his senses, would not that
trial of her fidelity have been sufficiently great? <i>Yet</i> I was not
content; and I strove to wound myself, while I was promising to give
vast sums for <i>but one</i> night, and forced her at last to waver, by
increasing the reward. <i>On this</i> I cried out, ‘Lo! I,&nbsp;the
gallant in disguise, to my sorrow, <i>and</i> lavish in promises, to my
misery, am thy real husband; thou treacherous woman! thou art caught,
<i>and</i> I the witness.’ She said nothing: only, overwhelmed with
silent shame, she fled from the house of treachery, together with her
wicked husband; and from her resentment against me, abhorring the whole
race of men, she used to wander<a class = "tag" name = "tag7_112" id =

pursuits of Diana. Then, a&nbsp;more violent flame penetrated to my
bones, thus deserted. I&nbsp;begged forgiveness, and owned myself in
fault; and that I too might have yielded to a similar fault, on presents
being made; if presents so large had been offered. Upon my confessing
this, having first revenged her offended modesty, she was restored to
me, and
<span class = "pagenum mckay">287</span>

though in herself she had given me but a small present, a&nbsp;dog as a

will excel all dogs in running.’ She gave her, too, a&nbsp;javelin,

<p class = "explanation">
There were two princes of the name of Cephalus; one, the son of Mercury
and Herse, the daughter of Cecrops; the other, the son of Deïoneus, king
of Phocis, and Diomeda, the daughter of Xuthus. The first was carried
off by Aurora, and went to live with her in Syria; the second married
Procris, the daughter of Erectheus, king of Athens. Though Apollodorus
seems, in the first instance, to follow this genealogy, in his third
book he confounds the actions of those two princes. Ovid and other
writers have spoken only of the son of Deïoneus, who was carried off by
Aurora, and having left her, according to them, returned to Procris.</p>

story. These will I first relate. O&nbsp;son of Æacus, I&nbsp;delight to
remember the happy time, during which, for the first years <i>after my
marriage</i>, I&nbsp;was completely blessed in my wife, <i>and</i> she

<span class = "linenum bell">VII. 799-834</span>
was happy in her husband. A&nbsp;mutual kindness and social love
possessed us both. Neither would she have preferred the bed of Jupiter
before my love; nor was there any woman that could have captivated me,
not <i>even</i> if Venus herself had come. Equal flames fired the
breasts <i>of us both</i>. The Sun striking the tops of the mountains
with his early rays, I&nbsp;was wont generally to go with youthful ardor
into the woods, to hunt; but I neither suffered my servants, nor my
horses, nor my quick-scented hounds to go <i>with me</i>, nor the knotty
nets to attend me; I&nbsp;was safe with my javelin. But when my right
hand was satiated with the slaughter of wild beasts, I&nbsp;betook
myself to the cool spots and the shade, and the breeze which was
breathing forth from the cool valleys. The gentle breeze was sought by
me, in the midst of the heat. For the breeze was I awaiting; that was a
refreshment after my toils: ‘Come, breeze,’ I was wont to sing, for I
remember it <i>full well</i>, ‘and, most grateful, refresh me, and enter
my breast; and, as thou art wont, be willing to assuage the heat with
which I am parched.’ Perhaps I may have added (<i>for</i> so my destiny
prompted me) many words of endearment, and I may have been accustomed to
say, ‘Thou art my great delight; thou dost refresh and cherish me; thou
makest me to love the woods and lonely haunts, and
<span class = "pagenum mckay">290</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">VII. 819-850</span>
thy breath is ever courted by my face.’ I was not aware that some one
was giving an ear, deceived by these ambiguous words; and thinking the
name of the breeze, so often called upon by me, to be that of a Nymph,
he believed some Nymph was beloved by me.</p>

<p>“The rash informer of an imaginary crime immediately went to Procris,
and with his whispering tongue related what he had heard. Love is a
credulous thing. When it was told her, she fell down fainting, with
sudden grief; and coming to, after a long time, she declared that she
was wretched, and <i>born</i> to a cruel destiny; and she complained
about my constancy. Excited by a groundless charge,<a class = "tag" name

which, <i>indeed</i>, is nothing; <i>and</i> fears a name without a
body; and, in her wretchedness, grieves as though about a real rival.
Yet she is often in doubt, and, in her extreme wretchedness, hopes she
may be deceived, and denies credit to the information; and unless she
beholds it herself, will not pass sentence upon
<span class = "pagenum bell">261</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">VII. 834-865</span>
the criminality of her husband. The following light of the morning had
banished the night, when I sallied forth, and sought the woods; and
being victorious in the fields, I&nbsp;said, ‘Come, breeze, and relieve
my pain;’ and suddenly I seemed to hear I know not what groans in the
midst of my words; yet I said, ‘Come hither, most delightful
<i>breeze</i>.’ Again, the falling leaves making a gentle noise,
I&nbsp;thought it was a wild beast, and I discharged my flying weapon.
It was Procris; and receiving the wound in the middle of her breast, she
cried out, ‘Ah, wretched me!’ When the voice of my attached wife was
heard, headlong and distracted, I&nbsp;ran towards <i>that</i> voice.
I&nbsp;found her dying, and staining her scattered vestments with blood,
and drawing her own present (ah, wretched me!) from out of her wound;
I&nbsp;lifted up her body, dearer to me than my own, in my guilty arms,
and I bound up her cruel wounds with the garments torn from my bosom;
and I endeavored to stanch the blood, and besought her that she would
not forsake

me, <i>thus</i> criminal, by her death. She, wanting strength, and now
expiring, forced herself to utter these few words:</p>

<p>“‘I suppliantly beseech thee, by the ties of our marriage, and by the
Gods above, and my own Gods, and if I have deserved anything well of
thee, by that <i>as well</i>, and by the cause of my death, my love even
now enduring, while I am perishing, do not allow the Nymph Aura
[<i>breeze</i>] to share with thee my marriage ties.’ She <i>thus</i>
spoke; and then, at last, I&nbsp;perceived the mistake of the name, and
informed her of it. But what avails informing her? She sinks; and her
little strength flies, together with her blood. And so long as she can
look on anything, she gazes on me, and breathes out upon me, on my
face,<a class = "tag" name = "tag7_118" id = "tag7_118" href =

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
The love which Cephalus, the son of Deïoneus, bore for the chase,
causing him to rise early in the morning for the enjoyment of his sport,
was the origin of the story of his love for Aurora. His wife, Procris,
as Apollodorus <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘tell’">tells</ins> us, carried on an amour with Pteleon, and, probably,
caused that report to be spread abroad, to divert attention from her own
intrigue. Cephalus, suspecting his wife’s infidelity, she fled to the
court of the second Minos, king of Crete, who fell in love with her.
Having, thereby, incurred the resentment of Pasiphaë, who adopted
several methods to destroy her rival, and, among others, spread poison
in her bed, she left Crete, and returned to Thoricus, the place of her
former residence, where she was reconciled to Cephalus, and gave him the
celebrated dog and javelin mentioned by Ovid.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The poets tell us, that this dog was made by Vulcan, and presented by
him to Jupiter, who gave him to Europa; and that coming to the hands of
her son Minos, he presented it to Procris. The wild beast, which ravaged
the country, and was pursued by
<span class = "pagenum mckay">292</span>
the dog of Procris, and which some writers tell us was a monstrous fox,
was probably a pirate or sea robber; and being, perhaps, pursued by some
Cretan officer of Minos, who escorted Procris back to her country, on
their vessels being shipwrecked near some rocks, it gave occasion to the
story that the dog and the monster had been changed into stone. Indeed,
Tzetzes says distinctly, that the dog was called Cyon, and the monster,
or fox, Alopis; and he also says that Cyon was the captain who brought
Procris back from Crete. It being believed that resentment had some
share in causing the death of Procris, the court of the Areiopagus
condemned Cephalus to perpetual banishment. The island of Cephalenia,
which received its name from him, having been given to him by
Amphitryon, he retired to it, where his son Celeus afterwards succeeded
him.</p>

that Peloponnesus at first had the names of ‘Apia’ and ‘Pelasgia.’ Some
suppose that the Pelasgi derived their name from Pelasgus, the son of
Jupiter; while other writers assert that they were so called from <span

made her to be the daughter of Perses, who, according to Diodorus
Siculus, was the son of Phœbus, and the brother of Æetes. Marrying her
uncle Æetes, she is said to have been the mother of Circe, Medea, and
Absyrtus. By some writers she is confounded with the Moon and with
Proserpine; as identical with the Moon, she has the epithets ‘Triceps’
and ‘Triformis,’ often given to her by the poets, because the Moon
sometimes is full, sometimes disappears, and often shows but part of her
disk.</p>

Bacchus apply to Tethys to have the age of the Nymphs, who had nursed
him, renewed, when he had just beheld Medea, and not Tethys, do it in
favor of Æson?</p>

<i>The Iberian sea.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 324. The Atlantic, or Western Ocean,

perhaps, was so called from the river Iberus, or Ebro, flowing through
it.</p>

<i>Cerambus.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 353. Antoninus Liberalis, quoting from
Nicander, calls him Terambus, and says that he lived at the foot of
Mount Pelion; he incurred the resentment of the Nymphs, who changed him
into a scarabæus, or winged beetle. Flying to the heights of Parnassus,
at the time of the flood of Deucalion, he thereby made his escape. Some
writers say that he was changed into a bird.</p>

<i>Wood of Ida.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 359. This was the grove of Ida, in
Phrygia. It is supposed that he refers to the story of Thyoneus, the son
of Bacchus, who, having stolen an ox from some Phrygian shepherds, was
pursued by them; on which Bacchus, to screen his son, changed the ox
into a stag, and invested Thyoneus with the garb of a hunter.</p>

<a name = "note7_52" id = "note7_52" href = "#tag7_52">52.</a>
<i>Mæra.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 362. This was the name of the dog of Icarius,
the father of Erigone, who discovered the murder of his master by the
shepherds of Attica, and was made a Constellation, under the name of the
Dog-star. As, however, the flight of Medea was now far distant from
Attica, it is more likely that the Poet refers to the transformation of
some female, named Mæra, into a dog, whose story has not come down to
us; indeed, Lactantius expresses this as his opinion. Burmann thinks
that it refers to the transformation of Hecuba, mentioned in the 13th
book, line 406; and that ‘Mæra’ is a corruption for some other name of
Hecuba.</p>

<i>The Coan matrons.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 363. Lactantius says that the women
of Cos, extolling their own beauty as superior to that of Venus,
incurred the resentment of that Goddess, and were changed by her into
cows. Another version of the story is, that these women, being offended
at Hercules for driving the oxen of Ægeon through their island, were
very abusive, on which Juno transformed them into cows: to this latter
version reference is made in the present passage.</p>

<i>Ialysian Telchines.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 365. Ialysus was one of the three
most ancient cities of Rhodes, and was said to have been founded by
Ialysus, whose parent was the Sun. The Telchines, or Thelchines, were a
race supposed to have migrated thither from Crete. They were persons of
great artistic skill, on which account they may, possibly, have obtained
the character of being magicians; such was the belief of Strabo.</p>

<i>Pleuron.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 382. This was a city of Ætolia, near Mount
Curius. It was far distant from Bœotia and Lake Hyrie. Some
commentators, therefore, suggest that the reading should be Brauron,
a&nbsp;village of Attica, near the confines of Bœotia.</p>

<p>
<a name = "note7_64" id = "note7_64" href = "#tag7_64">64.</a>
<i>Combe.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 383. She was the mother of the Curetes of
Ætolia, who, perhaps, received that name from Mount Curius. There was
another Combe, the daughter of Asopus, who discovered the use of brazen
arms, and was called Chalcis, from that circumstance. She was said to
have borne a hundred daughters to her husband.</p>

<i>Eumelus.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 390. He was the king of Patræ, on the
sea-coast of Achaia. Triptolemus visited him with his winged chariot; on
which, Antheas, the son of Eumelus, ascended it while his father was
sleeping, and falling from it, he was killed. He is, probably, here
referred to; and the reading should be ‘natum,’ and not ‘natam.’ Some
writers, however, suppose that his daughter was changed into a bird.</p>

<i>Titanian dragons.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 398. Her dragons are so called,
either because, as Pindar says, they had sprung from the blood of the
Titans, or because, according to the Greek tradition, the chariot and
winged dragons had been sent to Medea by the Sun, one of whose names was
Titan.</p>

Procrustes, who was slain by Theseus. Halcyone, the daughter of his son
Scyron, having been guilty of incontinence, was thrown into the sea by
her father, on which she was changed into a kingfisher, which bore her
name.</p>

<i>A gloomy cave.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 409. This cavern was called Acherusia.
It was situate in the country of the Mariandyni, near the city of
Heraclea, in Pontus, and was said to be the entrance of the Infernal
Regions. Cerberus was said to have been dragged from Tartarus by <ins

<a name = "note7_77" id = "note7_77" href = "#tag7_77">77.</a>
<i>Tokens of his race.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 423. Ægeus, leaving Æthra at
Trœzen, in a state of pregnancy, charged her, if she bore a son, to rear
him, but to tell no one whose son he was. He placed his own sword and
shoes under a large stone, and directed her to send his son to him when
he was able to lift the stone, and to take them from under it; and he
then returned to Athens, where he married Medea. When Theseus had grown
to the proper age, his mother led him to the stone under which his
father had deposited his sword and shoes, which he raised with ease, and
took them out. It was, probably, by means of this sword that Ægeus
recognized his son in the manner mentioned in the text.</p>

<i>Marathon.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 434. This was a town of Attica, adjoining a
plain of the same name, where the Athenians, under the command of
Miltiades, overthrew the Persians with immense slaughter. The bull which
Theseus slew there was presented by Neptune to Minos. Being brought into
Attica by Hercules, it laid waste that territory until it was slain by
Theseus.</p>

<i>Vulcan.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 437. By Antilia, Vulcan was the father of
Periphetes, a&nbsp;robber who infested Epidaurus, in the Peloponnesus.
He was so formidable with his club, that he was called Corynetas, from
<span class = "greek" title = "korunê">κορύνη</span>, the Greek for ‘a

<p>
<a name = "note7_81" id = "note7_81" href = "#tag7_81">81.</a>
<i>Cephisus.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 438. Procrustes was a robber of such
extreme cruelty that he used to stretch out, or lop off, the extremities
of his captives, according as they were shorter or longer than his
bedstead. He infested the neighborhood of Eleusis, in Attica, which was
watered by the Cephisus. He was put to death by Theseus.</p>

<p>
<a name = "note7_82" id = "note7_82" href = "#tag7_82">82.</a>
<i>Cercyon.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 439. It was his custom to challenge
travellers to wrestle, and to kill them, if they declined the contest,
or were beaten in it. Theseus accepted his challenge; and having
overcome him, put him to death. Eleusis was especially dedicated to
Ceres; there the famous Eleusinian mysteries of that Goddess were
held.</p>

<i>Alcathoë.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 443. Megara, or Alcathoë, which was founded
by Lelex, was almost destroyed by Minos, and was rebuilt by Alcathoüs,
the son of Pelops. He, flying from his father, on being accused of the
murder of his brother Chrysippus, retired to the city of Megara, where,
having slain a lion which was then laying waste that territory, he was
held in the highest veneration by the inhabitants.</p>

<p>
<a name = "note7_85" id = "note7_85" href = "#tag7_85">85.</a>
<i>Scyron.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 443. This robber haunted the rocks in the
neighborhood of Megara, and used to insist on those who became his
guests washing his feet. This being done upon the rocks, Scyron used to
kick the strangers into the sea while so occupied, where a tortoise lay
ready to devour the bodies. Theseus killed him, and threw his body down
the same rocks, which derived their name of Saronic, or Scyronic, from
this robber.</p>

<i>Seriphos.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 464. Commentators are at a loss to know why
Seriphos should here have the epithet ‘plana,’ ‘level,’ inasmuch as it

their criminals. The mice of this island were said to be able to gnaw
iron; perhaps, because they were starved by reason of its
unfruitfulness.</p>

number and magnitude of its oaks. Doves were said to give oracular

<i>To make attempts.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 721. Tzetzes informs us that she
was found by her husband in company with a young man named Pteleon, who

<i>Used to wander.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 746. Some writers say that she fled
to Crete, on which, Diana, who was aware of the attachment of Aurora for
her husband, made her a present of a javelin, which no person could
escape; and gave her the dog Lælaps, which no wild beast could outrun.
Such is the version given by Hyginus. But Apollodorus and Antoninus
Liberalis say, that she fled to Minos, who, prevailing over her virtue,
made her a present of the dog and the javelin. Afterwards, presenting
herself before her husband, disguised as a huntress, she gave him proofs
of the efficacy of them; and upon his requesting her to give them to
him, she exacted, as a condition, what must, apparently, have resulted
in a breach of the laws of conjugal fidelity. On his assenting to the
proposal, she discovered herself, and afterwards made him the presents
which he desired.</p>

month. Palæphatus says that it was not a wild beast, but a man called
Alopis.</p>

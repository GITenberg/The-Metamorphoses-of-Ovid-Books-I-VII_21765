EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
The ancient philosophers, unable to comprehend how something could be
produced out of nothing, supposed a matter pre-existent to the Earth in
its present shape, which afterwards received form and order from some
powerful cause. According to them, God was not the Creator, but the
Architect of the universe, in ranging and disposing the elements in
situations most suitable to their respective qualities. This is the
Chaos so often sung of by the poets, and which Hesiod was the first to
mention.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
It is clear that this system was but a confused and disfigured tradition
of the creation of the world, as mentioned by Moses; and thus, beneath
these fictions, there lies some faint glimmering of truth. The first two
chapters of the book of Genesis will be found to throw considerable
light on the foundation of this Mythological system of the world’s
formation.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Hesiod, the most ancient of the heathen writers who have enlarged upon
this subject, seems to have derived much of his information
<span class = "pagenum mckay">12</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">I. 32-40</span>
from the works of Sanchoniatho, who is supposed to have borrowed his
ideas concerning Chaos from that passage in the second verse of the
first Chapter of Genesis, which mentions the darkness that was spread
over the whole universe&mdash;‘and darkness was upon the face of the
deep’&mdash;for he expresses himself almost in those words. Sanchoniatho
lived before the Trojan war, and professed to have received his
information respecting the original construction of the world from a
priest of ‘Jehovah,’ named Jerombaal. He wrote in the Phœnician
language; but we have only a translation of his works,
<span class = "pagenum bell">4</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">I. 32-43</span>
by Philo Judæus, which is by many supposed to be spurious. It is,
however, very probable, that from him the Greeks borrowed their notions
regarding Chaos, which they mingled with fables of their own
invention.</p>

Earth, encompassed <i>by it</i>; he added also springs, and numerous
pools and lakes, and he bounded the rivers as they flowed downwards,

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
According to Ovid, as in the book of Genesis, man is the last work of
the Creator. The information derived from Holy Writ is here presented to
us, in a disfigured form. Prometheus, who tempers the earth, and
Minerva, who animates his workmanship, is God, who formed man, and
‘breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.’</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Some writers have labored to prove that this Prometheus, of the heathen
Mythology, was a Scriptural character. Bochart believes him to have been
the same with Magog, mentioned in the book of Genesis. Prometheus was
the son of Iapetus, and Magog was the son of Japhet, who, according to
that learned writer, was identical with Iapetus. He says, that as Magog
went to settle in Scythia, so did Prometheus; as Magog either invented,
or improved, the art of founding metals, and forging iron, so, according
to the heathen poets, did Prometheus. Diodorus Siculus asserts that
Prometheus was the first to teach mankind how to produce fire from the
flint and steel.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The fable of Prometheus being devoured by an eagle, according to some,
is founded on the name of Magog, which signifies ‘a man devoured by
<span class = "pagenum bell">9</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">I. 89-105</span>
sorrow.’ Le&nbsp;Clerc, in his notes on Hesiod, says, that Epimetheus,
the brother of Prometheus, was the same with the Gog of Scripture, the
brother of Magog. Some writers, again, have exerted their ingenuity to
prove that Prometheus is identical with the patriarch Noah.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">The</span> formation of man is followed by a
succession of the four ages of the world. The first is the Golden Age,
during which Innocence and Justice alone govern the world.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The</span> Golden Age was first founded,
which, without any avenger, of its own accord, without laws, practised
both faith and rectitude. Punishment, and the fear <i>of it</i>, did not
exist, and threatening decrees were not read upon the brazen
<i>tables</i>,<a class = "tag" name = "tag1_28" id = "tag1_28" href =

were in safety without any avenger. The pine-tree, cut from its
<i>native</i> mountains, had not
<span class = "pagenum mckay">18</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">I. 98-105</span>
yet descended to the flowing waves, that it might visit a foreign
region; and mortals were acquainted with no shores beyond their own. Not
as yet did deep ditches surround the towns; no trumpets of straightened,
or clarions of crooked brass,<a class = "tag" name = "tag1_29" id =
"tag1_29" href = "#note1_29">29</a> no helmets, no swords <i>then</i>
existed. Without occasion for soldiers, the minds <i>of men</i>, free
from care, enjoyed an easy tranquillity.</p>

<p>The Earth itself, too, in freedom, untouched by the harrow, and
wounded by no ploughshares, of its own accord produced everything; and
men, contented with the food created under no compulsion, gathered the
fruit of the arbute-tree, and the strawberries of the mountain, and
cornels, and blackberries
<span class = "pagenum bell">10</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">I. 105-124</span>
adhering to the prickly bramble-bushes, and acorns which had fallen from
the wide-spreading tree of Jove. <i>Then</i> it was an eternal spring;
and the gentle Zephyrs, with their soothing breezes, cherished the
flowers produced without any seed. Soon, too, the Earth unploughed
yielded crops of grain, and the land, without being renewed, was
whitened with the heavy ears of corn. Then, rivers of milk, then, rivers
of nectar were flowing, and the yellow honey was distilled from the
green holm oak.</p>

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
The heathen poets had learned, most probably from tradition, that our
first parents lived for some time in peaceful innocence; that, without
tillage, the garden of Eden furnished them with fruit and food in
abundance; and that the animals were submissive to their commands: that
after the fall the ground <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘become’">became</ins> unfruitful, and yielded nothing without labor;
and that nature no longer spontaneously acknowledged man for its master.
The more happy days of our first parents they seem to have styled the
Golden Age, each writer being desirous to make his own country the scene
of those times of innocence. The Latin writers, for instance, have
placed in Italy, and under the reign of Saturn and Janus, events, which,
as they really <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘happen’">happened</ins>, the Scriptures relate in the histories of Adam
and of Noah.</p>

it makes its appearance in all its deformity.</p>

but more precious than <i>that of</i> yellow brass. Jupiter shortened
the duration of the former spring, and divided the year into four
periods by means of winters, and summers, and unsteady autumns, and
short springs. Then, for the first time, did the parched air glow with
sultry heat, and the ice, bound up by the winds, was pendant. Then, for
the first time, did men enter houses; <i>those</i> houses were caverns,

The Poet here informs us, that during the Golden Age, a&nbsp;perpetual
spring reigned on the earth, and that the division of the year into
seasons was not known until the Silver Age. This allusion to Eden is
very generally to be found in the works of the
<span class = "pagenum mckay">21</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">I. 150-156</span>

followed by the Iron Age, which still continues. The meaning is, that
man gradually degenerated from his primeval innocence, and arrived at
that state of wickedness and impiety, of which the history of all ages,
ancient and modern, presents us with so many lamentable examples.</p>

The limited nature of their views, and the fact that their exuberant
fancy was the source from which they derived many of their alleged
events, naturally betrayed the ancient writers into great
inconsistencies. For in the Golden Age of Saturn, we find wars waged,
and crimes committed. Saturn expelled his father, and seized his throne;
Jupiter, his son, treated Saturn as he had done his father Uranus; and
Jupiter, in his turn, had to wage war against the Giants, in their
attempt to dispossess him of the heavens.</p>

The war of the giants, which is here mentioned, is not to be confounded
with that between Jupiter and the Titans, who were inhabitants of
heaven. The fall of the angels, as conveyed by tradition, probably gave
rise to the story of the Titans; while, perhaps, the building of the
tower of Babel may have laid the foundation of that of the attempt by
the giants to reach heaven. Perhaps, too, the descendants of Cain, who
are probably the persons mentioned in Scripture as the children ‘of men’
and ‘giants,’ were the race depicted under the form of the Giants, and
the generation that sprung from their blood. See Genesis, ch.&nbsp;vi.

words
<span class = "pagenum bell">16</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">I. 216-228</span>
of Scripture, relative to the determination of the Almighty to punish
the earth by a deluge, as disclosed in the sixth chapter of Genesis. The
Poet tells us, that the King of heaven calls the Gods to a grand
council, to deliberate upon the punishment of mankind, in retribution
for their wickedness. The words of Scripture are, “And God saw that the
wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of
the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And it repented the
Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
And the Lord said, ‘I will destroy man, whom I have created from the
face of the earth; both man and beast, and the creeping thing, and the
fowls of the air: for it repenteth me that I have made them<ins class =

If Ovid is not here committing an anachronism, and making Jupiter,
before the deluge, relate the story of a historical personage,
<span class = "pagenum mckay">27</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">I. 244-255</span>
who existed long after it, the origin of the story of Lycaon must be
sought in the antediluvian narrative. It is just possible that the
guilty Cain may have been the original of Lycaon. The names are not very
dissimilar: they are each mentioned as the first murderer; and the fact,
that Cain murdered Abel at the moment when he was offering sacrifice to
the Almighty, may have given rise to the tradition that Lycaon had set
human flesh before the king of heaven. The Scripture, too, tells us,
that Cain was personally called to account by the Almighty for his deed
of blood.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The punishment here inflicted on Lycaon was not very dissimilar to that
<span class = "pagenum bell">18</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">I. 244-257</span>
with which Cain was visited. Cain was sentenced to be a fugitive and a
wanderer on the face of the earth; and such is essentially the character
of the wolf, shunned by both men and animals. Of course, there are many
points to which it is not possible to extend the parallel. Some of the
ancient writers tell us, that there were two Lycaons, the first of whom
was the son of Phoroneus, who reigned in Arcadia about the time of the
patriarch Jacob; and the second, who succeeded him, polluted the
festivals of the Gods by the sacrifice of the human race; for, having
erected an altar to Jupiter, at the city of Lycosura, he slew human
victims on it, whence arose the story related by the Poet. This solution
is given by Pausanias, in his Arcadica. We are also told by that
historian, and by Suidas, that Lycaon was, notwithstanding,
a&nbsp;virtuous prince, the benefactor of his people, and the promoter
of improvement.</p>

through the open plains, and bear away, together with the standing corn,
the groves, flocks, men, houses, and temples, together with their sacred
<i>utensils</i>. If any house remained, and, not thrown down, was able
to resist ruin so vast, yet the waves, <i>rising</i> aloft, covered the
roof of that <i>house</i>, and the towers tottered, overwhelmed beneath
the stream. And now sea and land had no mark of distinction; everything

possession of a hill, another sits in a curved boat, and plies the oars
there where he had lately ploughed; another sails over the standing
corn, or the roof of his country-house under water; another catches a
fish on the top of an elm-tree. An anchor (if chance so directs) is

Ovid here speaks; and though that deluge was generally said to have
overflowed Thessaly only, he has evidently adopted in his narrative the
tradition of the universal deluge, which all nations seem to have
preserved. He says, <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "‘that’ missing in McKay">that</ins> the sea <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘joined in its’">joined its</ins> waters to those falling from heaven.

Both Noah and Deucalion were saved for their virtuous conduct; when Noah

tells us that Deucalion, when saved, raised an altar to Jupiter the
Liberator. The Poet tells us, that Deucalion’s deluge was to be the

of the sacred Goddess, the roof of which was defiled with foul moss, and
whose altars were standing without fires. Soon as they reached the steps
of the temple, each of them fell prostrate on the ground, and,
trembling, gave kisses to the cold pavement. And thus they said:</p>

<p>“If the Deities, prevailed upon by just prayers, are to be mollified,
if the wrath of the Gods is to be averted; tell us, O&nbsp;Themis, by
what art the loss of our race is to be repaired, and give thy
assistance, O&nbsp;most gentle <i>Goddess</i> to our ruined fortunes.”
The Goddess was moved, and gave this response: “Depart from my temple,
and cover your heads,<a class = "tag" name = "tag1_67" id = "tag1_67"
href = "#note1_67">67</a> and loosen

by her words to break the silence, and <i>then</i> refuses to obey the
commands of the Goddess; and begs her, with trembling lips, to grant her
pardon, and dreads to offend the shades of her mother by casting her
bones. In the meantime they reconsider the words of the response given,
<i>but</i> involved in dark obscurity, and they ponder them among
themselves. Upon that, the son of Prometheus soothes the daughter of
Epimetheus with <i>these</i> gentle words, and says, “Either is my
discernment fallacious, or the oracles are just, and advise no
sacrilege. The earth is the great mother; I&nbsp;suspect that the stones
in the body of the earth are the bones meant; these we are ordered to
throw behind our backs.” Although she, descended from Titan,<a class =

by this interpretation of her husband, still her hope is involved in
doubt; so much do they both distrust the advice of heaven; but what harm
will it do to try?</p>

<p>They go down, and they veil their heads, and ungird their garments,
and cast stones, as ordered, behind their footsteps. The stones (who
could have believed it, but that antiquity is a witness <i>of the
thing?</i>) began to lay aside their hardness and their stiffness, and
by degrees to become soft; and when softened, to assume a <i>new</i>
form. Presently after, when they were grown larger, a&nbsp;milder
nature, too, was conferred on them, so that some shape of man might be
seen <i>in them</i>, yet though but imperfect; and as if from the marble
commenced <i>to be wrought</i>, not sufficiently distinct, and very like
to rough statues. Yet that part of them which was humid with any
moisture, and earthy, was turned into <i>portions adapted for</i> the
use of the body. That which is solid, and cannot be bent, is changed
into bones; that which was just now a vein, still

<p class = "explanation">
In the reign of Deucalion, king of Thessaly, the course of the river
Peneus was stopped, probably by an earthquake. In the same year so great
a quantity of rain fell, that all Thessaly was overflowed. Deucalion and
some of his subjects fled to Mount Parnassus; where they remained until
the waters abated. The children of those who were preserved are the
stones of which the Poet here speaks. The Fable, probably, has for its
foundation the double meaning of the word ‘Eben,’ or ‘Aben,’ which
signifies either ‘a stone,’ or ‘a child.’ The Scholiast on Pindar tells
us, too, that the word <span class = "greek" title = "laos">λάος</span>,
which means people, formerly also signified ‘a stone.’</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The brutal and savage nature of the early races of men may also have
added strength to the tradition that they derived their original from
stones. After the inundation, Deucalion is said to have repaired to
Athens, <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘when’">where</ins> he built a temple to Jupiter, and instituted
sacrifices in his honor. Some suppose that Cranaus reigned at Athens
when Deucalion retired thither; though Eusebius informs us it was under
the reign of Cecrops. Deucalion was the son of Prometheus, and his wife
Pyrrha was the daughter of his uncle, Epimetheus. After his death, he
received the honor of a temple, and was worshipped as a Divinity.</p>

mixture, they conceive; and all things arise from these two.</p>

<p>And although fire is the antagonist of heat, <i>yet</i> a moist vapor
creates all things, and this discordant concord is suited for
generation; when, therefore, the Earth, covered with mud by the late
deluge, was thoroughly heated by the æthereal sunshine and a penetrating
warmth, it produced species <i>of creatures</i> innumerable; and partly
restored the former shapes, and partly gave birth to new monsters. She,

<p class = "explanation">
The story of the serpent Python, being explained on philosophical
principles, seems to mean, that the heat of the sun, having dissipated
the noxious exhalations emitted by the receding waters, the reptiles,
which had been produced from the slime left by the flood, immediately
disappeared.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
If, however, we treat this narrative as based on historical facts, it is
probable that the serpent represented some robber who infested the
neighborhood of Parnassus, and molested those who passed that way for
the purpose of offering sacrifice. A&nbsp;prince, either bearing the
name of Apollo, or being a priest of that God, by his destruction
liberated that region from this annoyance. This event gave rise to the
institution of the Pythian games, which were celebrated near Delphi.
Besides the several contests mentioned by Ovid, singing, dancing, and
instrumental music, formed part of the exercises of these games. The
event which Ovid here places soon after the deluge, must have happened
much later, since in the time of Deucalion, the worship of Apollo was
not
<span class = "pagenum mckay">39</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">I. 452-474</span>

thee to be what thou wishest, and the charms of thy person are an

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
To explain this Fable, it must be laid down as a principle that there
were originally many Jupiters, and Apollos, and Mercuries, whose
intrigues being, in lapse of time, attributed to but one individual,
that fact accounts for the great number of children which claimed those
respective Gods for their fathers.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Some prince probably, for whom his love of learning had acquired the
name of Apollo, falling in love with Daphne, pursued her to the brink of
the river Peneus, into which, being accidentally precipitated, she
perished in her lover’s sight. Some laurels growing near the spot,
perhaps gave rise to the story of her transformation; or possibly the
etymology of the word ‘Daphne,’ which in Greek signifies a laurel, was
the foundation of the Fable. Pausanias, however, in his Arcadia, gives
another version of this story. He says that Leucippus, son of Œnomaus,
king of Pisa, falling in love with Daphne, disguised himself in female
apparel, and devoted himself to her service. He soon procured her
friendship and confidence; but Apollo, who was his rival, having
discovered his fraud, one day redoubled the heat of the sun. Daphne and
her companions going to bathe, obliged Leucippus to follow their
example, on which, having discovered his stratagem, they killed him with
the arrows which they carried for the purposes of hunting.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Diodorus Siculus tells us that Daphne was the same with Manto, the
daughter of Tiresias, who was banished to Delphi, where she delivered
oracles, of the language of which Homer availed himself in the
composition of his poems. The inhabitants of Antioch asserted that the
adventure here narrated happened in the suburbs of their city, which
thence derived its name of Daphne.</p>

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
The Greeks frequently embellished their mythology with narratives of
Phœnician or Egyptian origin. The story of Io probably came from Egypt.
Isis was one of the chief divinities of that country, and her worship
naturally passed, with their colonies, into foreign countries. Greece
received it when Inachus went to settle there, and in lapse of time
Isis, under the name of Io, was supposed to have been his daughter, and
the fable was invented which is here narrated by Ovid.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The Greek authors, Apollodorus, Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, and Pausanias,
say that Io was the daughter of Inachus, the first king of Argos; that
Jupiter carried her away to Crete; and that by her he had a son named
Epaphus, who went to reign in Egypt, whither his mother accompanied
<span class = "pagenum bell">37</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">I. 601-619</span>
him. They also tell us that she married Apis, or Osiris, who, after his
death, was numbered among the Deities of Egypt by the name of Serapis.
From them we also learn that Juno, being actuated by jealousy, on the
discovery of the intrigue, put Io under the care of her uncle Argus,
a&nbsp;man of great vigilance, but that Jupiter having slain him, placed
his mistress on
<span class = "pagenum mckay">48</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">I. 601-619</span>
board of a vessel which had the figure of a cow at its head; from which
circumstance arose the story of the transformation of Io. The Greek
writers also state, that the Bosphorus, a&nbsp;part of the Ægean sea,
derived its name from the passage of Io in the shape of a cow.</p>

take away his life.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">In</span> the meantime Juno looked down
upon the midst of the fields, and wondering that the fleeting clouds had
made the appearance of night under bright day, she perceived that they
were not <i>the vapors</i> from a river, nor were they raised from the

After she had found him not in heaven, she said, “I&nbsp;am either

<i>she</i> is beautiful. The daughter of Saturn, though unwillingly,
extols the appearance of the cow; and likewise inquires, whose it is,
and whence, or of what herd it is, as though ignorant of the truth.
Jupiter falsely asserts that it was produced out of the earth, that the
owner may cease to be inquired after. The daughter of Saturn begs her of
him as a gift. What can <i>he</i> do? It is a cruel thing to deliver up
his <i>own</i> mistress, <i>and</i> not to give her up is a cause of
suspicion. It is shame which persuades him on the one hand, love

dissuades him on the other. His shame would have been

subdued by his love; but if so trifling a gift as a cow should be
refused to the sharer of his descent and his couch, she might
<i>well</i> seem not to be a cow.</p>

<p>The rival now being given up <i>to her</i>, the Goddess did not
immediately lay aside all apprehension; and she was <i>still</i> afraid
of Jupiter, and was fearful of her being stolen, until she gave her to
Argus, the son of Aristor, to be kept <i>by him</i>. Argus had his head
encircled with a hundred eyes. Two of them used to take rest in their
turns, the rest watched, and used to keep on duty.<a class = "tag" name
= "tag1_101" id = "tag1_101" href = "#note1_101">101</a> In whatever
manner he stood, he looked towards Io; although turned away, he
<i>still</i> used to have Io before his eyes. In the daytime he suffers
her to feed; but when the sun is below the deep earth, he shuts her up,
and ties a cord round her neck undeserving <i>of such treatment</i>. She
feeds upon the leaves of the arbute tree, and bitter herbs, and instead
of a bed the unfortunate <i>animal</i> lies upon the earth, that does
not always have grass <i>on it</i>, and drinks of muddy streams. And
when, too, she was desirous, as a suppliant, to stretch out her arms to
Argus, she had no arms to stretch out to Argus; and she uttered lowings
from her mouth, <i>when</i> endeavoring to complain. And at <i>this</i>
sound she was terrified, and was affrighted at her own voice.</p>

<p>She came, too, to the banks, where she was often wont to sport, the
banks of <i>her father</i>, Inachus; and soon as she beheld her new
horns in the water, she was terrified, and, astonished, she recoiled
from herself. The Naiads knew her not, and Inachus himself knew her not,
who she was; but she follows her father, and follows her sisters, and
suffers herself to be touched, and presents herself to them, as they
admire <i>her</i>. The aged Inachus held her some grass he had plucked;
she licks his hand, and gives kisses to the palms of her father. Nor
does she restrain her tears; and if only words would follow, she would
implore his aid, and
<span class = "pagenum mckay">50</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">I. 648-671</span>
would declare her name and misfortunes. Instead of words, letters, which
her foot traced in the dust, completed the sad discovery of the
transformation of her body. “Ah, wretched me!” exclaims her father
Inachus; and clinging to the horns and the neck
<span class = "pagenum bell">39</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">I. 651-674</span>
of the snow-white cow, as she wept, he repeats, “Ah, wretched me! and
art thou my daughter, that hast been sought for by me throughout all
lands? While undiscovered, thou wast a lighter grief <i>to me</i>, than
<i>now, when</i> thou art found. Thou art silent, and no words dost thou
return in answer to mine; thou only heavest sighs from the depth of thy
breast, and what alone thou art able to do, thou answerest in lowings to
my words. But I, in ignorance <i>of this</i>, was preparing the bridal
chamber, and the <i>nuptial</i> torches for thee; and my chief hope was
that of a son-in-law, my next was that of grandchildren. But now must
thou have a mate from the herd, now, <i>too</i>, an offspring of the
herd. Nor is it possible for me to end grief so great by death; but it
is a detriment to be a God; and the gate of death being shut against me,
extends my grief to eternal ages.”</p>

<p>While thus he lamented, the starry Argus removed her away, and
carried the daughter, <i>thus</i> taken from her father, to distant
pastures. He himself, at a distance, occupies the lofty top of a
mountain, whence, as he sits, he may look about on all sides.</p>

his cap, and lays aside his wings; his wand alone was retained. With
this, as a shepherd, he drives some she-goats through the pathless

<p>The keeper appointed by Juno, charmed by the sound of this new

this stone; for, indeed, in no <i>other</i> place is the herbage more
abundant for thy flock; and thou seest, too, that the shade is

talking he occupied the passing day with his discourse, and by playing
upon his joined reeds he tried to overpower his watchful eyes. Yet
<i>the other</i> strives hard to overcome soft sleep; and although sleep
was received by a part of his eyes, yet with a part he still keeps

This appears to have been an Egyptian fable, imported into the works of
the Grecian poets. Pan was probably a Divinity of the Egyptians, who
worshipped nature under that name, as we are told by Herodotus and
Diodorus Siculus. As, however, according to Nonnus, there were not less
than twelve Pans, it is possible that the adventure here related may
have been supposed to have happened to one of them who was a native of
Greece. He was most probably the inventor of the Syrinx, or Pandæan
pipe, and, perhaps, formed his first instrument from the produce of the
banks of the River Ladon, from which circumstance Syrinx may have been
styled the daughter of that river.</p>

It is impossible to divine the reason why his eyes were said to have
been set by Juno in the tail of the peacock; though, perhaps, the
circumstance has no other foundation than the resemblance of the human
eye to the spots in the tail of that bird, which was consecrated to
Juno. Besides, if Juno is to be considered the symbol of Air, or Æther,
through which light is transmitted to us, it is not surprising that the

back, and casting to Heaven those looks which then alone she could, by
her groans, and her tears, and her mournful lowing, she seemed to be
complaining of Jupiter, and to be begging an end of her sorrows.</p>

<p>He, embracing the neck of his wife with his arms,

entreats her, at length, to put an end to her punishment; and he says,
“Lay aside thy fears for the future; she shall never <i>more</i> be the
occasion of any trouble to thee;” and <i>then</i> he bids the Stygian
waters to hear this <i>oath</i>. As soon as the Goddess is pacified,
<i>Io</i> receives her former shape, and she becomes what she was
before; the hairs flee from off of her body, her horns decrease, and the
orb of her eye becomes less; the opening of her jaw is contracted; her
shoulders and her hands return, and her hoof, vanishing, is disposed of
into five nails; nothing of the cow remains to her, but the whiteness of
her appearance; and the Nymph, contented with the service of two feet,
is raised erect <i>on them</i>; and <i>yet</i> she is afraid to speak,
lest she should low like a cow, and timorously tries again the words
<i>so long</i> interrupted. Now, as a Goddess, she is worshipped by the

<p>To her, at length, Epaphus<a class = "tag" name = "tag1_113" id =
"tag1_113" href = "#note1_113">113</a> is believed to have been born
from the seed of great Jove, and throughout the cities he possesses
temples joined to <i>those of</i> his parent. Phaëton, sprung from the
Sun, was equal to him in spirit and in years; whom formerly, as he
uttered great boasts, and yielded not <i>at all</i> to him, and proud of
his father, Phœbus, the grandson of Inachus could not endure; and said,
“Thou, <i>like</i> a madman, <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘believes’">believest</ins> thy mother in all things, and art
puffed up with the conceit of an imaginary father.”</p>

<p>Phaëton blushed, and in shame repressed his resentment; and he
reported to his mother, Clymene,<a class = "tag" name = "tag1_114" id =
"tag1_114" href = "#note1_114">114</a> the reproaches of Epaphus; and
said, “Mother, to grieve thee still more, I,&nbsp;the free, the bold

can be uttered against us, and that they cannot be refuted; but do

thou, if only I am born of a divine race, give me some proof of so great
a descent, and claim me for heaven.” <i>Thus</i> he spoke, and threw his
arms around the neck of his mother; and besought her, by his own head
and by that of Merops,<a class = "tag" name = "tag1_115" id = "tag1_115"
href = "#note1_115">115</a> and by the nuptial torches of his sisters,
that she would give him some token of his real father.</p>

<p>It is a matter of doubt whether Clymene was more moved by the
entreaties of Phaëton, or by resentment at the charge made against her;
and she raised both her arms to heaven, and, looking up to the light of
the Sun, she said, “Son, I&nbsp;swear to thee, by this beam, bright with
shining rays, which both hears and sees us, that thou, that thou, <i>I
say</i>, wast begotten by this Sun, which thou beholdest; by this
<i>Sun</i>, which governs the world. If I utter an untruth, let him deny
himself to be seen by me, and let this light prove the last for my eyes.
Nor will it be any prolonged trouble for thee to visit thy father’s
dwelling; the abode where he arises is contiguous to our regions.<a

If only thy inclination disposes thee, go forth, and thou shalt inquire
of himself.”</p>

<p>Phaëton immediately springs forth, overjoyed, upon these words of his
mother, and reaches the skies in imagination; and he passes by his own
Æthiopians, and the Indians situate beneath the rays of the Sun,<a class

To the elucidation of this narrative, already given, we will only add,

<i>Forms changed into new bodies.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 1. Some commentators
cite these words as an instance of Hypallage as being used for ‘corpora
mutata in novas formas,’ ‘bodies changed into new forms;’ and they fancy
that there is a certain beauty in the circumstance that the proposition
of a subject which treats of the changes and variations of bodies should
be framed with a transposition of words. This supposition is perhaps
based rather on the exuberance of a fanciful imagination than on solid
grounds, as if it is an instance of Hypallage, it is most probably quite
accidental; while the passage may be explained without any reference to
Hypallage, as the word ‘forma’ is sometimes used to signify the thing
itself; thus the words ‘formæ deorum’ and ‘ferarum’ are used to signify
‘the Gods,’ or ‘the wild beasts’ themselves.</p>

with some justice, that this invocation is not sufficiently long or

<i>No Sun.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 10. Titan. The Sun is so called, on account
of his supposed father, Hyperion, who was one of the Titans. Hyperion is
thought to have been the first who, by assiduous observation, discovered
the course of the Sun, Moon, and other luminaries. By them he regulated
the time for the seasons, and imparted this knowledge to others. Being
thus, as it were, the father of astronomy, he has been feigned by the
poets to have been the father of the Sun and the Moon.</p>

<i>Nature.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 21. ‘Natura’ is a word often used by the Poet
without any determinate signification, and to its operations are
ascribed all those phenomena which it is found difficult or impossible
to explain upon known and established principles. In the present
instance it may be considered to mean the invisible agency of the Deity
in reducing Chaos into a form of order and consistency. ‘Et’ is
therefore here, as grammarians term it, an expositive particle; as if
the Poet had said, ‘Deus sive natura,’ ‘God, or in other words,
nature.’</p>

<i>The element of the vaulted heaven.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 26. This is a
periphrasis, signifying the regions of the firmament or upper air, in
which the sun and stars move; which was supposed to be of the purest
fire and the source of all flame. The heavens are called ‘convex,’ from
being supposed to assume the same shape as the terrestrial globe which
they surround.</p>

<i>The lowermost place.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 31. ‘Ultima’ must not be here
understood in the presence of ‘infima,’ or as signifying ‘last,’ or
‘lowest,’ in a strict philosophical sense, for that would contradict the
account of the formation of the world given by Hesiod, and which is here
closely followed by Ovid; indeed, it would contradict his own
words,&mdash;‘Circumfluus humor coercuit solidum orbem.’ The meaning
seems to be, that the waters possess the lowest place only in respect to
the earth whereon we tread, and not relatively to the terrestrial globe,
the supposed centre of the system, inasmuch as the external surface of
the earth in some places rises considerably, and leaves the water to
subside in channels.</p>

<i>Are some of them swallowed up.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 40. He here refers to
those rivers which, at some distance from their sources, disappear and
continue their course under ground. Such was the stream of Arethusa, the
Lycus in Asia, the Erasinus in Argolis, the Alpheus in Peloponnesus, the
Arcas in Spain, and the Rhone in France. Most of these, however, after
descending into the earth, appear again and discharge their waters into
the sea.</p>

‘jussit,’ signifying ‘ordered,’ or ‘commanded,’ is considered as being
remarkably sublime and appropriate, and serving well to express the ease
wherewith an infinitely powerful Being accomplishes the most difficult
works. There is the same beauty here that was long since remarked by
Longinus, one of the most celebrated critics among the ancients, in the
words used by Moses, ‘And God said, Let there be light, and there was
light,’ Genesis, ch.&nbsp;i. ver. 3.</p>

<i>On the right-hand side.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 45. The “right hand” here
refers to the northern part of the globe, and the “left hand” to the
southern. He here speaks of the zones. Astronomers have divided the
heavens into five parallel circles. First, the equinoctial, which lies
in the middle, between the poles of the earth, and obtains its name from
the equality of days and nights on the earth while the sun is in its
plane. On each side are the two tropics, at the distance of 23 deg. 30
min., and described by the sun when in his greatest declination north
and south, or at the summer and winter solstices. That on the north side
of the equinoctial is called the tropic of Cancer, because the sun
describes it when in that sign of the ecliptic; and that on the south
side is, for a similar reason, called the tropic of Capricorn. Again, at
the distance of 23½ degrees from the poles are two other parallels
called the polar circles, either because they are near to the poles, or
because, if we suppose the whole frame of the heavens to turn round on
the plane of the equinoctial, these circles are marked out by the poles
of the ecliptic. By means of these parallels, astronomers have divided
the heavens into four zones or tracks. The whole space between the two
tropics is the middle or torrid zone, which the equinoctial divides into
two equal parts. On each side of this are the temperate zones, which
extend from the tropics to the two polar circles. And lastly, the
portions enclosed by the polar circles make up the frigid zones. As the
planes of these circles produced till they reached the earth, would also
impress similar parallels upon it, and divide it in the same manner as
they divide the heavens, astronomers have conceived five zones upon the
earth, corresponding to those in the heavens, and bounded by the same
circles.</p>

<p>
<a name = "note1_15" id = "note1_15" href = "#tag1_15">15.</a>
<i>That which is the middle one.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 49. The ecliptic in
which the sun moves, cuts the equator in two opposite points, at an
angle of 23½ degrees; and runs obliquely from one tropic to another, and
returns again in a corresponding direction. Hence, the sun, which in the
space of a year, performs the revolution of this circle, must in that
time be twice vertical to every place in the torrid zone, except
directly under the tropics, and his greatest distance from their zenith
at noon, cannot exceed 47 degrees. Thus his rays being often
perpendicular, or nearly so, and never very oblique, must strike more
forcibly, and cause more intense heat in that spot. Being little
acquainted with the extent and situation of the earth, the ancients
believed it uninhabitable. Modern discovery has shown that this is not
the case as to a considerable part of the torrid zone, though with some
parts of it our acquaintance is still very limited.</p>

<i>Deep snow covers two.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 50. The two polar or frigid
zones. For as the sun never approaches these nearer than the tropic on
that side, and is, during one part of the year, removed by the
additional extent of the whole torrid zone, his rays must be very
oblique and faint, so as to leave these tracts exposed to almost
perpetual cold.</p>

<p>
<a name = "note1_17" id = "note1_17" href = "#tag1_17">17.</a>
<i>He placed as many more.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 51. The temperate zones,
lying between the torrid and the frigid, partake of the character of
each in a modified degree, and are of a middle temperature between hot
and cold. Here, too, the distinction of the seasons is manifest. For in
either temperate zone, when the sun is in that tropic, which borders
upon it, being nearly vertical, the heat must be considerable, and
produce summer; but when he is removed to the other tropic by a distance
of 47 degrees, his rays will strike but faintly, and winter will be the
consequence. The intermediate spaces, while he is moving from one tropic
to the other, make spring and autumn.</p>

<i>Eurus took his way.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 61. The Poet, after remarking
that the air is the proper region of the winds, proceeds to take notice
that God, to prevent them from making havoc of the creation, subjected
them to particular laws, and assigned to each the quarter whence to
direct his blasts. Eurus is the east wind, being so called from its
name, because it blows from the east. As Aurora, or the morning, was
always ushered in by the sun, who rises eastward, she was supposed to
have her <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘habitations’">habitation</ins> in the eastern quarter of the world; and
often, in the language of ancient poetry, her name signifies the
east.</p>

<i>The realms of Nabath.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 61. From Josephus we learn that
Nabath, the son of Ishmael, with his eleven brothers, took possession of
all the country from the river Euphrates to the Red Sea, and called it
Nabathæa. Pliny the Elder and Strabo speak of the Nabatæi as situated
between Babylon and Arabia Felix, and call their capital Petra. Tacitus,
in his Annals (Book ii. ch.&nbsp;57), speaks of them as having a king.
Perhaps the term ‘Nabathæa regna’ implies here, generally, the whole of
Arabia.</p>

derivation because they cherish and enliven nature.</p>

<i>Boreas invaded Scythia.</i>]&mdash;Ver. <ins class = "corr mckay"
title = "McKay reads ‘34’">64</ins>. Under the name of Scythia, the
ancients generally comprehended all the countries situate in the extreme
northern regions. ‘Septem trio,’ meaning the northern region of the
world, is so called from the ‘Triones,’ a constellation of seven stars,
near the North Pole, known also as the Ursa Major, or Greater Bear, and
among the country people of our time by the name of Charles’s Wain.
Boreas, one of the names of ‘Aquilo,’ or the ‘north wind,’ is derived
from a Greek word, signifying ‘an eddy.’ This name was probably given to
it from its causing whirlwinds occasionally by its violence.</p>

<i>The forms of the Gods.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 73. There is some doubt what
the Poet here means by the ‘forms of the Gods.’ Some think that the
stars are meant, as if it were to be understood that they are forms of
the Gods. But it is most probably only a poetical expression for the
Gods themselves, and he here assigns the heavens as the habitation of
the Gods and the stars; these last, according to the notion of the
Platonic philosophers being either intelligent beings, or guided and
actuated by such.</p>

<i>Framed him from divine elements.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 78. We have here
strong grounds for contending that the ancient philosophers, and after
them the poets, in their account of the creation of the world followed a
tradition that had been copied from the Books of Moses. The formation of
man, in Ovid, as well as in the Book of Genesis, is the last work of the
Creator, and was, for the same purpose, that man might have dominion
over the other animated works of the creation.</p>

been a general name for the horn or trumpet; whereas the “tuba” was a
straight trumpet, while the ‘lituus’ was bent into a spiral shape. Lydus
says that the ‘lituus’ was the sacerdotal trumpet, and that it was
employed by Romulus when he proclaimed the title of his newly-founded
city. Acro says that it was peculiar to the cavalry, while the ‘tuba’
belonged to the infantry. The notes of the ‘lituus’ are usually
described as harsh and shrill.</p>

<i>Through the means of both.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 142. Gold forms, perhaps,
more properly the sinews of war than iron. The history of Philip of
Macedon gives a proof of this, as he conquered Greece more by bribes
than the sword, and used to say, that he deemed no fortress impregnable,
where there was a gate large enough to admit a camel laden with
gold.</p>

<i>There is a way on high.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 168. The Poet here gives a
description of the court of heaven; and supposing the galaxy, or Milky
Way, to be the great road to the palace of Jupiter, places the
habitations of the Gods on each side of it, and adjoining the palace
itself. The mythologists also invented a story, that the Milky Way was a
track left in the heavens by the milk of Juno flowing from the mouth of
Hercules, when suckled by her. Aristotle, however, suspected what has
been since confirmed by the investigations of modern science, that it
was formed by the light of innumerable stars.</p>

<i>Shook the awful locks.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 179. This awful nod of
Jupiter, the sanction by which he confirms his decrees, is an idea taken
from Homer; by whom it is so vividly depicted at the end of the first
book of the Iliad, that Phidias, in his statue of that God, admired for
the awful majesty of its looks, is said to have derived his conception
of the features from that description. Virgil has the same idea in the
Æneid, book x; ‘Annuit, et totum metu tremefecit Olympum.’</p>

<p>
<a name = "note1_42" id = "note1_42" href = "#tag1_42">42.</a>
<i>The Nymphs.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 192. The terrestrial Nymphs were the
Dryads and Hamadryads, who haunting the woods, and the duration of their
existence depending upon the life of particular trees, derived their
name from the Greek word <span class = "greek" title =
"drus">δρῦς</span>, ‘an oak.’ The Oreades were nymphs who frequented the
mountains, while the Napeæ lived in the groves and valleys. There were
also Nymphs of the sea and of the rivers; of which, the Nereids were so
called from their father Nereus, and the Oceanitides, from Oceanus.
There were also the Naiads, or nymphs of the fountains, and many
others.</p>

<i>Thus when an impious band.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 200. It is a matter of
doubt whether he here refers to the conspiracies of Brutus and Cassius
against Julius Cæsar, or whether to that against Augustus, which is
mentioned by Suetonius, in the nineteenth chapter of his History. As
Augustus survived the latter conspiracy, and the parallel is thereby
rendered more complete, probably this is the circumstance here alluded
to.</p>

<i>Together with Cyllene.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 217. Cyllenus, or Cyllene, was
a mountain of Arcadia, sacred to Mercury, who was hence called by the
poets Cyllenius. Lycæus was also a mountain of Arcadia, sacred to Pan,
and was covered with groves of pine-trees.</p>

<i>Of the Molossians.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 226. The Molossi were a people of
Epirus, on the eastern side of the Ambracian gulf. Ovid here commits a
slight anachronism, as the name was derived from Molossus, the son of
Neoptolemus, long after the time of Lycaon. Besides, as Burmann
observes, who could believe that ‘wars could be waged at such an early
period between nations so distant as the Molossi and the Arcadians?’
Apollodorus says, that it was a child of the same country, whose flesh
Lycaon set before Jupiter. Other writers say that it was Nyctimus, the
son of Lycaon, or Arcas, his grandson, that was slain by him.</p>

<i>The savage Erinnys.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 241. Erinnys was a general name
given to the Furies by the Greeks. They were three in
number&mdash;Alecto, Tisiphone, and Megæra. These were so called, either
from the Greek <span class = "greek" title = "eris nou">ἔρις νοῦ</span>,
‘the discord of the mind,’ or from <span class = "greek" title = "en tê era naiein">ἐν τῇ <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ἵρα ‘hira’">ἔρα</ins> ναίειν</span>, ‘their inhabiting the earth,’ watching

<i>To place frankincense.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 249. In those early ages, corn
or wheaten flour, was the customary offering to the Deities, and not
frankincense, which was introduced among the luxuries of more refined
times. Ovid is consequently guilty of an anachronism here.</p>

<p>
<a name = "note1_49" id = "note1_49" href = "#tag1_49">49.</a>
<i>That a time should come.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 256. Lactantius informs us
that the Sibyls predicted that the world should perish by fire. Seneca
also, in his consolation to Marcia, and in his Quæstiones Naturales,
mentions the same destined termination of the present state of the
universe. It was a doctrine of the Stoic philosophers, that the stars
were nurtured with moisture, and that on the cessation of this
nourishment the conflagration of the universe would ensue.</p>

<p>
<a name = "note1_51" id = "note1_51" href = "#tag1_51">51.</a>
<i>Iris.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 271. The mention of Iris, the goddess of the
rainbow, in connection with the flood of Deucalion, cannot fail to
remind us of the ‘bow set in the cloud, for a token of the covenant
between God and the earth,’ on the termination of Noah’s
flood.&mdash;Gen. x. 14.</p>

<i>The mouths of their fountains.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 281. The expressions

of the 7th chapter of Genesis, ‘The fountains of the great deep were
broken up.’</p>

<p>
<a name = "note1_53" id = "note1_53" href = "#tag1_53">53.</a>
<i>The wolf swims.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 304. One commentator remarks here,
that there was nothing very wonderful in a dead wolf swimming among the
sheep without devouring them. Seneca is, however, too severe upon our
author in saying that he is trifling here, in troubling himself on so
serious an occasion with what sheep and wolves are doing: for he gravely
means to say, that the beasts of prey are terrified to that degree that
they forget their carnivorous propensities.</p>

<i>The Aonian.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 313. Aonia was a mountainous region of
Bœotia; and Actæa was an ancient name of Attica, from <span class =

<p>
<a name = "note1_55" id = "note1_55" href = "#tag1_55">55.</a>
<i>By name Parnassus.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 317. Mount Parnassus has two
peaks, of which the one was called ‘Tichoreum,’ and was sacred to
Bacchus; and the other ‘Hypampeum,’ and was devoted to Apollo and the
Muses.</p>

<i>The Corycian Nymphs.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 320. The Corycian Nymphs were so
called from inhabiting the Corycian cavern in Mount Parnassus; they were
fabled to be the daughters of Plistus, a&nbsp;river near Delphi. There
was another Corycian cave in Cilicia, in Asia Minor.</p>

<p>
<a name = "note1_57" id = "note1_57" href = "#tag1_57">57.</a>
<i>The prophetic Themis.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 321. Themis is said to have
preceded Apollo in giving oracular responses at Delphi. She was the
daughter of Cœlus and Terra, and was the first to instruct men to ask of
the Gods that which was lawful and right, whence she took the name of
Themis, which signifies in Greek, ‘that which is just and right.’</p>

<a name = "note1_58" id = "note1_58" href = "#tag1_58">58.</a>
<i>The native purple shells.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 332. ‘Murex’ was the name
of the shell-fish from which the Tyrian purple, so much valued by the
ancients, was procured. Some suppose that the meaning here is, that
Triton had his shoulders tinted with the purple color of the murex. It
is, however, more probable that the Poet means to say that he had his
neck and shoulders studded with the shells of the murex, perhaps as a
substitute for scales.</p>

<p>
<a name = "note1_59" id = "note1_59" href = "#tag1_59">59.</a>
<i>He bids him blow.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 333. There were several Tritons, or
minor sea gods. The one mentioned here, the chief Triton, was fabled to
be the son of Neptune and Amphitrite, who always preceded Neptune in his
course, and whose arrival he was wont to proclaim by the sound of his
shell. He was usually represented as swimming, with the upper part of
his body resembling that of a human being, while his lower parts
terminated with the tail of a fish.</p>

<a name = "note1_60" id = "note1_60" href = "#tag1_60">60.</a>
<i>The hollow-wreathed trumpet.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 335. The ‘Buccina,’ or,
as we call it, ‘the conch shell,’ was a kind of horn, or trumpet, made
out of a shell, called ‘buccinum.’ It was sometimes artificially curved,
and sometimes straight, retaining the original form of the shell. The
twisted form of the shell was one of the characteristic features of the
trumpet, which, in later times, was made of horn, wood, or metal, so as
to imitate the shell. It was chiefly used among the Romans, to proclaim
the watches of the day and of the night, which watches were thence
called ‘buccina prima,’ ‘secunda,’ etc. It was also blown at funerals,
and at festive entertainments, both before sitting down to table and
after. Macrobius tells us, that Tritons holding ‘buccinæ’ were fixed on
the roof of the temple of Saturn.</p>

and to resume their march.</p>

<p>
<a name = "note1_62" id = "note1_62" href = "#tag1_62">62.</a>
<i>Now the sea.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 343. This and the two following lines
are considered as entitled to much praise for their terseness and
brevity, as depicting by their short detached sentences the
instantaneous effect produced by the commands of Neptune in reducing his
dominions to a state of order.</p>

<p>
<a name = "note1_63" id = "note1_63" href = "#tag1_63">63.</a>
<i>A common origin.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 352. Because Prometheus was the
father of Deucalion and Epimetheus of Pyrrha; Prometheus and Epimetheus
being the sons of Iapetus. It is in an extended sense that he styles her
‘sister,’ she being really his cousin.</p>

<p>
<a name = "note1_64" id = "note1_64" href = "#tag1_64">64.</a>
<i>The arts of my father.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 363. He alludes to the story

with fire stolen from heaven.</p>

the ancients, before entering a temple, either to sprinkle themselves
with water, or to wash the body all over.</p>

<p>
<a name = "note1_67" id = "note1_67" href = "#tag1_67">67.</a>
<i>Cover your heads.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 382. It was a custom among the
ancients to cover their heads in sacrifice and other acts of worship,
either as a mark of humility, or, according to Plutarch, that nothing of
ill omen might meet their sight, and thereby interrupt the performance
of the rites.</p>

<i>Under the same name.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 410. With his usual propensity
for punning, he alludes to the use of the word ‘vena,’ as signifying
either ‘a vein’ of the body, or a ‘streak’ or ‘vein’ in stone, according
to the context.</p>

<p>
<a name = "note1_70" id = "note1_70" href = "#tag1_70">70.</a>
<i>The seven-streamed Nile.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 423. The river Nile
discharges itself into the sea by seven mouths. It is remarkable for its
inundations, which happen regularly every year, and overflow the whole
country of Egypt. To this is chiefly owing the extraordinary fertility
of the soil of that country; for when the waters subside, they leave
behind them great quantities of mud, which, settling upon the land,
enrich it, and continually reinvigorate it.</p>

<p>
<a name = "note1_71" id = "note1_71" href = "#tag1_71">71.</a>
<i>Instituted sacred games.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 446. Yet Pausanias, in his
Corinthiaca, tells us that they were instituted by Diomedes; others,
again, say by Eurylochus the Thessalian; and others, by Amphictyon, or
Adrastus. The Pythian games were celebrated near Delphi, on the Crissæan
plain, which contained a race-course, a&nbsp;stadium of 1000 feet in
length, and a theatre, in which the musical contests took place. They
were once held at Athens, by the advice of Demetrius Poliorcetes,
because the Ætolians were in possession of the passes round Delphi. They
were most probably originally a religious ceremonial, and were perhaps
only a musical contest, which consisted in singing a hymn in honor of
the Pythian God, accompanied by the music of the cithara. In later
times, gymnastic and equestrian games and exercises were introduced
there. Previously to the 48th Olympiad, the Pythian games had been
celebrated at the end of every eighth year; after that period they were
held at the end of every fourth year. When they ceased to be solemnized
is unknown; but in the time of the Emperor Julian they still continued
to be held.</p>

<i>Crown of beechen leaves.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 449. This was the prize
which was originally given to the conquerors in the Pythian games. In
later times, as Ovid tells us, the prize of the victor was a laurel
chaplet, together with the palm branch, symbolical of his victory.</p>

<a name = "note1_74" id = "note1_74" href = "#tag1_74">74.</a>
<i>A fillet tied together.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 477. The ‘vitta’ was a band
encircling the head, and served to confine the tresses of the hair. It
was worn by maidens and by married women also; but the ‘vitta’ assumed
on the day of marriage was of a different form from that used by
virgins. It was not worn by women of light character, or even by the
‘libertinæ,’ or female slaves who had been liberated; so that it was not
only deemed an emblem of chastity, but of freedom also. It was of
various colors: white and purple are mentioned. In the later ages the
‘vitta’ was sometimes set with pearls.</p>

<i>Hymen.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 480. Hymen, or Hymenæus, was one of the Gods
of Marriage; hence the name ‘Hymen’ was given to the union of two
persons in marriage.</p>

<p>
<a name = "note1_76" id = "note1_76" href = "#tag1_76">76.</a>
<i>The nuptial torch.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 483. Plutarch tells us, that it
was the custom in the bridal procession to carry five torches before the
bride, on her way to the house of her husband. Among the Romans, the
nuptial torch was lighted at the parental hearth of the bride, and was
borne before her by a boy, whose parents were alive. The torch was also
used at funerals, for the purpose of lighting the pile, and because
funerals were often nocturnal ceremonies. Hence the expression of
Propertius,&mdash; ‘Vivimus inter utramque facem,’ ‘We are living
between the two torches.’ Originally, the ‘tædæ’ seem to have been slips
or lengths of resinous pine wood: while the ‘fax’ was formed of a bundle
of wooden staves, either bound by a rope drawn round them in a spiral
form, or surrounded by circular bands at equal distances. They were used
by travellers and others, who were forced to be abroad after sunset;
whence the reference in line 493 to the hedge ignited through the
carelessness of the traveller, who has thrown his torch there on the
approach of morning.</p>

<p>
<a name = "note1_78" id = "note1_78" href = "#tag1_78">78.</a>
<i>Claros and Tenedos.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 516. Claros was a city of Ionia,
famed for a temple and oracle of Apollo, and near which there was a
mountain and a grove sacred to him. There was an island in the Myrtoan
Sea of that name, to which some suppose that reference is here made.
Tenedos was an island of the Ægean Sea, in the neighborhood of Troy.
Patara was a city of Lycia, where Apollo gave oracular responses during
six months of the year. It was from Patara that St. Paul took ship for
Phœnicia, Acts, xxi. 1, 2.</p>

<i>The properties of simples.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 522. The first cultivators
of the medical art pretended to nothing beyond an acquaintance with the
medicinal qualities of herbs and simples; it is not improbable that
inasmuch as the vegetable world is nourished and raised to the surface
of the earth in a great degree by the heat of the sun, a&nbsp;ground was
thereby afforded for allegorically saying that Apollo, or the Sun, was
the discoverer of the healing art.</p>

<i>The youthful God.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 531. Apollo was always represented
as a youth, and was supposed never to grow old. The Scholiast on the
Thebais of Statius, b.&nbsp;i., v.&nbsp;694, says, ‘The reason is,
because Apollo is the Sun; and because the Sun is fire, which never
grows old.’ Perhaps the youthfulness of the Deity is here mentioned, to
account for his ardent pursuit of the flying damsel.</p>

<p>
<a name = "note1_82" id = "note1_82" href = "#tag1_82">82.</a>
<i>As when the greyhound.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 533. The comparison here of
the flight of Apollo after Daphne, to that of the greyhound after the
hare, is considered to be very beautifully drawn, and to give an
admirable illustration of the eagerness with which the God pursues on
the one hand, and the anxiety with which the Nymph endeavors to escape
on the other. Pope, in his Windsor Forest, has evidently imitated this
passage, where he describes the Nymph Lodona pursued by Pan, and
transformed into a river. His words are&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>‘Not half so swift the trembling <ins class = "corr bell" title =

<p>When the fierce eagle cleaves the liquid sky;</p>

<p>As from the God she flew with furious pace,</p>
<p>Or as the God more furious urged the chase.</p>

Both editions modernized Pope’s spelling; only the differences between
the two texts are marked.</p>

The greyhound was probably called ‘canis Gallicus,’ from having been

<i>The song of triumph.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 560. The Poet here pays a
compliment to Augustus and the Roman people. The laurel was the emblem
of victory among the Romans. On such occasions the ‘fasces’ of the
general and the spears and javelins of the soldiers were wreathed with
laurel; and after the time of Julius Cæsar, the Roman general, when
triumphing, wore a laurel wreath on his head, and held a branch of
laurel in his hand.</p>

Peneus ran through it, but not with the violence which Ovid here

more like oil than water.</p>

<i>Enipeus.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 579. The Enipeus rises in Mount Othrys, and
runs through Thessaly. Virgil (Georgics, iv. 468) calls it ‘Altus
Enipeus,’ the deep Enipeus.</p>

<p>
<a name = "note1_94" id = "note1_94" href = "#tag1_94">94.</a>
<i>Apidanus.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 580. The Apidanus, receiving the stream of
the Enipeus at Pharsalia, flows into the Peneus. It is supposed by some
commentators to be here called ‘senex,’ aged, from the slowness of its
tide. But where it unites the Enipeus it flows with violence, so that it
is probably called ‘senex,’ as having been known and celebrated by the
poets from of old.</p>

<i>Inachus.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 583. This was a river of Argolis, now known
as the Naio. It took its rise either in Lycæus or Artemisium, mountains
of Arcadia. Stephens, however, thinks that Lycæus was a mountain of
Argolis.</p>

<i>Lerna.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 597. This was a swampy spot on the Argive
territory, where the poets say that the dragon with seven heads, called
Hydra, which was slain by Hercules, had made his haunt. It is not
improbable that the pestilential vapors of this spot were got rid of by
means of its being drained under the superintendence of Hercules, on
which fact the story was founded. Some commentators, however, suppose
the Lerna to have been a flowing stream.</p>

<i>Soporiferous wand.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 671. This was the ‘caduceus,’ or
staff, with which Mercury summoned the souls of the departed from the
shades, induced slumber, and did other offices pertaining to his
capacity as the herald and messenger of Jupiter. It was represented as
an olive branch, wreathed with two snakes. In time of war, heralds and
ambassadors, among the Greeks, carried a ‘caduceus.’ It was not used by
the Romans.</p>

Macedonian hat, except that the brims of the latter were turned up at
the sides.</p>

<i>The Ortygian Goddess.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 694. Diana is called
“Ortygian,” from the isle of Delos, where she was born, one of whose

<i>Ladon.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 702. This was a beautiful river of Arcadia,
flowing into the Alpheus: its banks were covered with vast quantities of
reeds. Ovid here calls its stream ‘placidum;’ whereas in the fifth book
of the Fasti, l. 89, he calls it ‘rapax,’ ‘violent;’ and in the second
book of the Fasti, l. 274, its waters are said to be ‘citæ aquæ,’ swift
waters. Some commentators have endeavored to reconcile these
discrepancies; but the probability is, that Ovid, like many other poets,
used his epithets at random, or rather according to the requirements of
the measure for the occasion.</p>

<i>The linen-wearing throng.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 747. The priests, and
worshippers of Isis, with whom Io is here said to be identical, paid
their adoration to her clothed in linen vestments. Probably, Isis was
the first to teach the Egyptians the cultivation of flax.</p>

us, that this son of Jupiter, by Io, was the same as the Egyptian God,
Apis. Eusebius, quoting from Apollodorus, says that Epaphus was the son
of Io, by Telegonus, who married her.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Phaëton</span>, insulted by Epaphus, goes to
the Palace of Apollo, to beseech him to give some token that he is his
son. Apollo, having sworn, by the river Styx, to refuse him nothing that
he should desire, he immediately asks to guide his chariot for one day.
He is unsuccessful in the attempt, and, the horses running away, the
world is in danger of being consumed.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The</span> palace of the Sun was raised
high, on stately columns, bright with radiant gold, and carbuncle that
rivals the flames; polished ivory covered its highest top, <i>and</i>
double folding doors shone with the brightness of silver. The
workmanship <i>even</i> exceeded the material; for there Mulciber had
carved the sea circling round the encompassed Earth; and the orb of the
Earth, and the Heavens which hang over that orb. <i>There</i> the waves
have <i>in them</i> the azure Deities, both Triton, sounding <i>with his

green hair; some <i>are seen</i> borne upon fishes. The features in all
are not the same, nor, however, <i>remarkably</i> different: <i>they
are</i> such as those of sisters ought to be. The Earth has <i>upon
it</i> men and cities, and woods, and wild beasts, and rivers, and
Nymphs, and other Deities of the country. Over these is placed the
figure of the shining Heaven, and there are six Signs <i>of the
Zodiac</i> on the right door, and as many on the left.</p>

<p>Soon as the son of Clymene had arrived thither by an ascending path,
and entered the house of his parent, <i>thus</i> doubted of; he
immediately turned his steps to the presence
<span class = "pagenum bell">47</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">II. 20-57</span>
of his father, and stood at a distance, for he could not bear the
refulgence nearer. Arrayed in a purple garment, Phœbus was seated on a
throne sparkling with brilliant emeralds. On his right hand, and on his
left, the Days, the Months, the Years, the Ages, and the Hours were
arranged, at corresponding distances, and the fresh Spring was standing,
crowned with a chaplet of blossoms; Summer was standing naked, and
wearing garlands made of ears of corn; Autumn, too, was standing
besmeared with the trodden-out grapes; and icy Winter, rough with his
hoary hair.</p>

<p>Then the Sun, from the midst of this place, with those eyes with
which he beholds all things, sees the young man struck with fear at the
novelty of <i>these</i> things, and says, “What is the occasion of thy
journey <i>hither</i>? What dost thou seek, Phaëton, in this <i>my</i>
palace, a&nbsp;son not to be denied by his parent?”</p>

<p>He answers, “O thou universal Light of the unbounded World, Phœbus,
my father, if thou grantest me the use of that name; and if Clymene is
not concealing an error under a <i>false</i> pretext, give me, my
parent, some token, by which I may be believed to be really thy progeny;
and remove this uncertainty from my mind.” Thus he spoke; but his parent
took off the rays shining all around his head, and commanded him to come
nearer; and, having embraced him, he says, “<i>And</i> neither art thou
deserving to be denied to be mine, and Clymene has told thee thy true
origin; and that thou mayst have the less doubt, ask any gift thou mayst
please, that thou mayst receive it from me bestowing it. Let the lake,
by which the Gods are wont to swear, and which is unseen, <i>even</i> by
my eyes, be as a witness of my promise.”</p>

<p>Hardly had he well finished, when he asks for his father’s chariot,
and for the command and guidance of the wing-footed horses for one day.
His father repented that he had <i>so</i> sworn, and shaking his
splendid head
<span class = "pagenum mckay">59</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">II. 49-77</span>
three or four times, he said, “By thine have my words been made rash.
I&nbsp;wish I were allowed not to grant what I have promised!
I&nbsp;confess, my son, that this alone I would deny thee. <i>Still,</i>
I may dissuade thee: thy desire is not attended with safety. Thou
desirest, Phaëton, a&nbsp;gift <i>too</i> great, and <i>one</i> which is
suited neither to thy strength, nor to such youthful years. Thy lot is
that of a mortal; that which thou desirest, belongs not to mortals.
<i>Nay</i>, thou
<span class = "pagenum bell">48</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">II. 57-86</span>
aimest, in thy ignorance, at even more than it is allowed the Gods above
to obtain. Let every one be self-satisfied, <i>if he likes</i>; still,
with the exception of myself, no one is able to take his stand upon the
fire-bearing axle-tree. Even the Ruler of vast Olympus, who hurls the
ruthless bolts with his terrific right hand, cannot guide this chariot;
and <i>yet</i>, what have we greater than Jupiter? The first <i>part of
the</i> road is steep, and such as the horses, <i>though</i> fresh in
the morning, can hardly climb. In the middle of the heavens it is high
aloft, from whence it is often a <i>source of</i> fear, <i>even</i> to
myself, to look <i>down</i> upon the sea and the earth, and my breast
trembles with fearful apprehensions. The last stage is a steep descent,
and requires a sure command <i>of the horses</i>. Then, too, Tethys<a
class = "tag" name = "tag2_3" id = "tag2_3" href = "#note2_3">3</a>
herself, who receives me in her waves, extended below, is often wont to
fear, lest I should be borne headlong <i>from above</i>. Besides, the
heavens are carried round<a class = "tag" name = "tag2_4" id = "tag2_4"
href = "#note2_4">4</a> with a constant rotation, and carry <i>with
them</i> the lofty stars, and whirl them with rapid revolution. Against
this I have to contend; and that force which overcomes <i>all</i> other
things, <i>does</i> not <i>overcome</i> me; and I am carried in a
contrary direction to the rapid world. Suppose the chariot given <i>to
thee</i>; what couldst thou do? Couldst thou proceed, opposed to the
whirling poles, so that the rapid heavens should not carry thee away?
Perhaps, too, thou dost fancy in thy mind that there are groves, and
cities of the Gods, and temples
<span class = "pagenum mckay">60</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">II. 77-103</span>
enriched with gifts: <i>whereas</i>, the way is through dangers, and the
forms of wild beasts;<a class = "tag" name = "tag2_5" id = "tag2_5" href

the raging Lion, and the Scorpion, bending his cruel claws with a wide
compass, and the Crab, that bends his claws in a different manner; nor
is it easy for thee to govern the
<span class = "pagenum bell">49</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">II. 86-121</span>
steeds spirited by those fires which they have in their breasts, and
which they breathe forth from their mouths and their nostrils. Hardly
are they restrained by me, when their high-mettled spirit is <i>once</i>
heated, and their necks struggle against the reins. But do thou have a
care, my son, that I be not the occasion of a gift fatal to thee, and
while the matter <i>still</i> permits, alter thy intentions. Thou
askest, forsooth, a&nbsp;sure proof that thou mayst believe thyself
sprung from my blood? I&nbsp;give thee a sure proof in <i>thus</i> being
alarmed <i>for thee</i>; and by my paternal apprehensions, I&nbsp;am
shown to be thy father. Lo, behold my countenance! I&nbsp;wish, too,
that thou couldst direct thy eyes into my breast, and discover my
fatherly concern within! Finally, look around thee, upon whatever the
rich world contains, and ask for anything out of the blessings, so many
and so great, of heaven, of earth, and of sea; <i>and</i> thou shalt
suffer no denial. In this one thing alone I beg to be excused, which,
<i>called</i> by its right name, is a penalty, and not an honor; thou
art asking, Phaëton, a&nbsp;punishment instead of a gift. Why, in thy
ignorance, art thou embracing my neck with caressing arms? Doubt not;
whatever thou shalt desire shall be granted thee (by the Stygian waves I
have sworn it); but do thou make thy desire more considerately.”</p>

<p>He had finished his admonitions; and yet <i>Phaëton</i>
<span class = "pagenum mckay">61</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">II. 103-129</span>
resists his advice, and presses his point, and burns with eagerness for
the chariot. Wherefore, his parent having delayed as long as he could,
leads the young man to the lofty chariot, the gift of Vulcan. The
axle-tree was of gold, the poles were of gold; the circumference of the
exterior of the wheel was of gold; the range of the spokes was of
silver. Chrysolites and gems placed along the yoke in order, gave a
bright light from the reflected sun. And while the aspiring Phaëton is
admiring these things, and is examining the workmanship, behold! the
watchful Aurora opened her purple doors in the ruddy east, and her halls
filled with roses. The stars disappear, the troops whereof Lucifer
gathers, and moves the last from his station in the heavens. But the
father Titan, when he beheld the earth and the universe growing red, and
the horns of the far-distant Moon, as if about to vanish, orders the
swift Hours to yoke the horses. The Goddesses speedily perform his
commands, and lead forth the steeds from the lofty stalls,
<span class = "pagenum bell">50</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">II. 121-148</span>
snorting forth flames, and filled with the juice of Ambrosia; and
<i>then</i> they put on the sounding bits.</p>

<p>Then the father touched the face of his son with a hallowed drug, and
made it able to endure the burning flames, and placed the rays upon his
locks, and fetching from his troubled heart sighs presaging his sorrow,
he said: “If thou canst here at least, my boy, obey the advice of thy
father, be sparing of the whip, and use the bridle with nerve. Of their
own accord they are wont to hasten on; the difficulty is to check them
in their full career. And let not the way attract thee through the five
direct circles.<a class = "tag" name = "tag2_7" id = "tag2_7" href =
"#note2_7">7</a> There is a track cut
<span class = "pagenum mckay">62</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">II. 130-164</span>
obliquely, with a broad curvature, and bounded by the extremities of
three zones, and <i>so</i> it shuns the South pole, and the Bear united
to the North. Let thy way be here; thou wilt perceive distinct traces of
the wheels. And that heaven and earth may endure equal heat, neither
drive too low, nor urge the chariot along the summit of the sky. Going
forth too high, thou wilt set on fire the signs of the heavens; too low,
the earth; in the middle course thou will go most safely. Neither let
the right wheel bear thee off towards the twisted Serpent, nor let the
left lead thee to the low Altar; hold thy course between them. The rest
I leave to Fortune, who, I&nbsp;pray, may aid thee, and take more care
of thee, than thou dost of thyself. Whilst I am speaking, the moist
Night has touched the goals placed on the Western shores; delay is not
allowed me. I&nbsp;am required; the Morning is shining forth, the
darkness being dispersed. Seize the reins with thy hands; or if thou
hast a mind capable of change, make use of my advice, <i>and</i> not my
chariot, while thou art <i>still</i> able, and art even yet standing
upon solid ground; and while thou art not yet in thy ignorance filling
the chariot that thou didst so unfortunately covet.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum bell">51</span>

<p>The other leaps into the light chariot with his youthful body, and
stands aloft, and rejoices to take in his hand the reins presented <i>to
him</i>, and then gives thanks to his reluctant parent. In the meantime
the swift Pyroeis, and Eoüs and Æthon, the horses of the sun, and
Phlegon, <i>making</i> the fourth, fill the air with neighings, sending
forth flames, and beat the barriers with their feet. After Tethys,
ignorant of the destiny of her grandson, had removed these, and the
scope of the boundless universe was given them, they take the road, and
moving their feet through the air, they cleave the resisting clouds, and
raised aloft by their wings, they pass by the East winds that had arisen
from the same parts. But the weight was light; and such as the horses of
the sun could not feel; and the yoke was deficient of its wonted weight.
And as the curving ships, without proper ballast, are tossed about, and
unsteady, through their too great lightness, are borne through
<span class = "pagenum mckay">63</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">II. 165-191</span>
the sea, so does the chariot give bounds<a class = "tag" name = "tag2_8"
id = "tag2_8" href = "#note2_8">8</a> in the air, unimpeded by its usual
burden, and is tossed on high, and is just like an empty one.</p>

<p>Soon as the steeds have perceived this, they rush on, and leave the
beaten track, and run not in the order in which <i>they did</i> before.
He himself becomes alarmed; and knows not which way to turn the reins
entrusted <i>to him</i>, nor does he know where the way is, nor, if he
did know, could he control them. Then, for the first time, did the cold
Triones grow warm with sunbeams, and attempt, in vain, to be dipped in
the sea that was forbidden <i>to them</i>. And the Serpent which is
situate next to the icy pole, being before torpid with cold, and
formidable to no one, grew warm, and regained new rage from the heat.
They say, too,<a class = "tag" name = "tag2_9" id = "tag2_9" href =
"#note2_9">9</a> that thou, Boötes, being disturbed, took to flight;
although thou wast <i>but</i> slow, and thy wain impeded thee. But when,
from the height of the skies, the unhappy Phaëton looked down upon the
earth, lying far, very far beneath, he grew pale, and his knees shook
with a sudden terror; and in a light so great, darkness overspread
<span class = "pagenum bell">52</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">II. 181-216</span>
his eyes. And now he could wish that he had never touched the horses of
his father; and now he is sorry that he knew his descent, and that he
prevailed in his request; now desiring to be called the son of Merops.
He is borne along, just as a ship driven by the furious Boreas, to which
its pilot has given up the overpowered helm, <i>and</i> which he has
resigned to the Gods and <i>the effect of</i> his supplications. What
can he do? much of heaven is left behind his back; still more is before
his eyes. Either <i>space</i> he measures in his mind; and at one moment

and he neither lets go the reins, nor is he able to retain them; nor
does he know the names of the horses. In his fright, too, he sees
strange objects scattered everywhere in various parts of the heavens,
and the forms of huge wild beasts. There is a spot where the Scorpion
bends his arms into two curves, and with his tail and claws bending on
either side, he extends his limbs through the space of two signs <i>of
the Zodiac</i>. As soon as the youth beheld him wet with the sweat of
black venom, and threatening wounds with the barbed point <i>of his
tail</i>, bereft of sense, he let go the reins, in a chill of horror.
Soon as they, falling down, have touched the top of their backs, the
horses range at large: and no one restraining them, they go through the
air of an unknown region; and where their fury drives them thither,
without check, do they hurry along, and they rush on to the stars fixed
in the sky, and drag the chariot through pathless places. One while they
are mounting aloft, and now they are borne through steep places, and
<i>along</i> headlong paths in a tract nearer to the earth.</p>

<p>The Moon, too, wonders that her brother’s horses run lower than her
own, and the scorched clouds send forth smoke. As each region is most
elevated, it is caught by the flames, and cleft, it makes <i>vast</i>
chasms, and becomes dry, its moisture being carried away. The grass
grows pale; the trees, with their foliage, are burnt up; and the dry
standing corn affords fuel for its own destruction. <i>But</i> I am

their fortifications, and the flames turn whole nations, with their

<p>All the ground bursts asunder; and through the chinks, the light
penetrates into Tartarus, and startles the Infernal King with his
spouse. The Ocean too, is contracted, and that which lately was sea, is
a surface of parched sand; and the mountains which the deep sea had
covered, start up and increase <i>the number of</i> the scattered
Cyclades.<a class = "tag" name = "tag2_52" id = "tag2_52" href =

and Doris and their daughters, lay hid in the heated caverns. Three
times had Neptune ventured, with a stern countenance, to thrust his arms
out of the water; three times he was unable to endure the scorching heat
of the air. However, the genial Earth, as she was surrounded with sea,
amid the waters of the main, and the springs, dried up on every side,
which had hidden themselves in the bowels of their cavernous parent,
burnt-up, lifted up her all-productive face<a class = "tag" name =

her neck, and placed her hands to her forehead,
<span class = "pagenum bell">57</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">II. 276-303</span>
and shaking all things with a vast trembling, she sank down a little,
and retired below the spot where she is wont to be, and thus she spoke,
with a parched voice: “O&nbsp;sovereign of the Gods, if thou approvest
of this, if I have deserved it, why do thy lightnings linger? Let me,
<i>if</i> doomed to perish by the force of fire, perish by thy flames;
and alleviate my misfortune, by being the author <i>of it</i>. With
difficulty, indeed, do I open my mouth for these very words;” (the vapor
had oppressed her utterance.) “Behold my scorched hair, and such a
quantity of ashes over my eyes, so much <i>too</i>, over my features.
And dost thou give this as my recompense? this, as the reward of my
fertility and of my duty, in that I endure wounds from the crooked
plough and harrows, and am harassed all the year through? In that I
supply green leaves for the cattle, and corn, a&nbsp;wholesome food for
mankind, and frankincense for yourselves? But still, suppose that I am
deserving of destruction, why have the waves <i>deserved this</i>? Why
has thy brother deserved it? Why do the seas, delivered to him by lot,
decrease, and why do they recede still further from the sky? But if
regard for neither thy brother nor for myself influences thee, still
have consideration for thy own skies; look around, on either side,
<i>how</i> each pole is smoking; if the fire shall injure them, thy
palace will fall in ruins. See! Atlas<a class = "tag" name = "tag2_54"
id = "tag2_54" href = "#note2_54">54</a> himself is struggling, and

<p>Thus spoke the Earth; nor, indeed, could she any longer endure the
vapor, nor say more; and she withdrew

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
If we were to regard this fable solely as an allegory intended to convey
<span class = "pagenum bell">58</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">II. 304-310</span>
a moral, we should at once perceive that the adventure of Phaëton
represents the wilful folly of a rash young man, who consults his own
inclination, rather than the dictates of wisdom and prudence. Some
ancient writers tell us that Phaëton was the son of Phœbus and Clymene,
while others make the nymph Rhoda to have been his mother. Apollodorus,
following Hesiod, says that Hersa, the daughter of Cecrops, king of
Athens, was the mother of Cephalus, who was carried away by Aurora;
which probably means that he left Greece for the purpose of settling in
the East. Cephalus had a son named Tithonus, the father of Phaëton. Thus
Phaëton was the fourth in lineal descent from Cecrops, who reigned at
Athens about 1580, <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span> The story is
most probably based upon the fact of some excessive heat that happened
in his time. Aristotle supposes that at that period flames fell from
heaven, which ravaged several countries. Possibly the burning of the
cities of the plain, or the stay of the sun in his course at the command
of Joshua, may have been the foundation of the story. St. Chrysostom
suggests that it is based upon an imperfect version of the ascent of
Elijah in a chariot of fire; that name, or rather ‘Elias,’ the Greek
<ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘from’">form</ins> of it,
bearing a strong resemblance to <span class = "greek" title =
"Hêlios">Ἥλιος</span>, the Greek name of the sun. Vossius suggests that
this is an Egyptian history, and considers the story of the grief of
Phœbus for the loss of his son to be another version of the sorrows of
the Egyptians for the death of Osiris. The tears of the Heliades, or
sisters of Phaëton, he conceives to be identical with the lamentations
of the women who wept for the death of Thammuz. The Poet, when he tells
us that Phaëton abandoned his chariot on seeing The Scorpion, probably
intends to show that the event of which he treats happened in the month
in which the sun enters that sign.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Plutarch and Tzetzes tell us that Phaëton was a king of the Molossians,
who drowned himself in the Po; that he was a student of astronomy, and
foretold an excessive heat which happened in his reign, and laid waste
his kingdom. Lucian, also, in his Discourse on Astronomy, gives a
similar explanation of the story, and says that this prince dying very
young, left his observations imperfect, which gave rise to the fable
that he did not know how to drive the chariot of the sun to the end of
its course.</p>

Phaëton</i>, that unless he gives assistance, all things will perish in
direful ruin, mounts aloft to the highest eminence, from which he is
wont to spread the clouds over the spacious earth; from which he moves
his thunders, and hurls the brandished lightnings. But then, he had
neither clouds that he could
<span class = "pagenum bell">59</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">II. 310-335</span>
draw over the earth, nor showers that he could pour down from the sky.
He thundered aloud, and darted the poised lightning from his right ear
against the charioteer, and at the same moment deprived him both of his
life and his seat, and by his ruthless fires restrained the flames. The
horses are affrighted, and, making a bound in an opposite direction,
they shake the yoke from off their necks, and disengage themselves from
the torn harness. In one place lie the reins; in another, the axle-tree
wrenched away from the pole; in another part <i>are</i> the spokes of
the broken wheels; and the fragments of the chariot torn in pieces are
scattered far and wide. But Phaëton, the flames consuming his yellow
hair, is hurled headlong, and is borne in a long <ins class = "corr

And first seeking his lifeless limbs, <i>and</i> then his bones, she
found his bones, however, buried on a foreign bank. She laid herself
down on the spot; and bathed with tears the name she read on the marble,
and warmed it with her open breast. The daughters of the Sun mourn no
less, and give tears, an unavailing gift, to his death; and beating
their breasts with their hands, they call Phaëton both night and day,
who is doomed not to hear their sad complaints; and they lie scattered
about the tomb.</p>

<p>The Moon had four times filled her disk, by joining her horns; they,
according to their custom (for use had made custom), uttered
lamentations; among whom Phaëthusa, the eldest of the sisters, when she
was desirous to lie on the ground, complained that her feet had grown
stiff; to whom the fair Lampetie attempting to come, was detained by a
root suddenly formed. A&nbsp;third, when she is endeavoring to tear her
hair with her hands, tears off leaves; one complains that her legs are
held fast by the trunk of a tree, another that her arms are become long
branches. And while they are wondering at these things, bark closes upon
their loins; and by degrees, it encompasses their stomachs, their
breasts, their shoulders, and their hands; and only their mouths are
left uncovered, calling upon their mother. What is their mother to do?
but run here and there, whither frenzy leads her, and join her lips
<i>with theirs</i>, while <i>yet</i> she may? That is not enough; she
tries to pull their bodies out of the trunks <i>of the trees</i>, and
with her hands to tear away the tender
<span class = "pagenum mckay">73</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">II. 360-380</span>
branches; but from thence drops of blood flow as from a wound. Whichever
<i>of them</i> is wounded, cries out, “Spare me, mother, O&nbsp;spare
me, I&nbsp;pray; in the tree my body is being torn. And now farewell.”
The bark came over the last words.</p>

<p>Thence tears flow forth; and amber distilling from the new-formed
branches, hardens in the sun; which the clear river receives and sends
to be worn by the Latian matrons.</p>

they entreat him, with suppliant voice, not to determine to bring
darkness over the world. Jupiter, as well, excuses the hurling of his
lightnings, and imperiously adds threats to entreaties. Phœbus calls
together his steeds, maddened and still trembling with terror, and,

grief, which gave rise to the story that they were changed into the
poplars on its banks, which distilled amber. Some writers say, that they
were changed into larch trees, and not poplars. Hesiod and Pindar also
make mention of this tradition. Possibly, Cycnus, being a friend of
Phaëton, may have died from grief at his loss, on which the poets graced
his attachment with the story that he was changed into a swan.
Apollodorus mentions two other persons of the name of Cycnus. One was
the son of Mars, and was killed before Troy; the other, as Hesiod tells
us, was killed by Hercules. Lucian, in his satirical vein, tells us,
that inquiring on the banks of the Po for the swans, and the poplars
distilling amber, he was told that no such things had ever been seen
there; and that even the tradition of Phaëton and his sisters was
utterly unknown to the inhabitants of those parts.</p>

moderate, nor such as would be given by a virgin. He stops her as she is
preparing to tell him in what wood she has been hunting, by an embrace,

Cicero (On the Nature of the Gods, Book iii.) tells us, that Lycaon had
a daughter who delighted in the chase, and that Jupiter, the second of
that name, the king of Arcadia, fell in love with her. This was the
ground on which she was said to have been a favorite of Diana. The story
of Calisto having been received into Heaven, and forming the
Constellation of the Bear, was perhaps grounded on the fact of Lycaon,
her father, having been the first known to take particular notice of
this Constellation. The story of the request of Juno, that Tethys will
not receive this new Constellation into the Ocean, is probably derived
from the circumstance, that the Bear, as well as the other stars within
the Arctic Circle, never sets.</p>

consumed his time to no purpose, in entreating me with soft words, he
prepared <i>to use</i> violence, and followed me. I&nbsp;fled, and I
left the firm shore, and wearied myself in vain on the yielding sand.
Then I invoked both Gods and men; but my voice did not reach any mortal.
A&nbsp;virgin was moved for a virgin, and gave me assistance. I&nbsp;was

Ericthonius was fabled to be the son, or foster-child, of Athene, or
Minerva, perhaps because he was the son of the daughter of Cranaus, who
had the name of Athene, by a priest of Vulcan, which Divinity was said
to have been his progenitor. St.&nbsp;Augustine alleges that he was
exposed, and found in a temple dedicated to Minerva and Vulcan. His name
being composed of two words, <span class = "greek" title =

"chthôn">χθὼν</span>, signifying ‘contention,’ and ‘earth,’ Strabo
imagines that he was the son of Vulcan and the Earth. But it seems that
the real ground on which he was called by that name was, that he
disputed the right to the crown of Athens with Amphictyon, on the death
of Cranaus, the second king. Amphictyon prevailed, but Ericthonius
succeeded him. To hide his legs, which were deformed, he is said
<span class = "pagenum mckay">83</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">II. 590-605</span>
to have invented chariots; though that is not likely, as Egypt, from
which Greece had received many colonies, was acquainted with the use of
them from the earliest times. He is also said to have instituted the
festival of the Panathenæa, at Athens, whence, in process of time, it
was adopted by the whole of Greece.</p>

<p>Something still remained in addition to what she had said. She heaved
a sigh from the bottom of her breast, and the tears bursting forth,
trickled down her cheeks, and thus she said: “The Fates prevent me, and
I am forbidden to say any more,

and the use of my voice is precluded. My arts, which have brought the
wrath of a Divinity upon me, were not of so much value; I&nbsp;wish that
I had not been acquainted with the future. Now the human shape seems to
be withdrawing from me; now grass pleases <i>me</i> for my food; now I
have a desire to range over the extended plains; I&nbsp;am turned into a
mare, and into a shape kindred <i>to that of my father</i>. But yet, why
entirely? For my father partakes of both forms.”</p>

<p>As she was uttering such words as these, the last part of her
complaint was but little understood; and her words were confused. And
presently neither <i>were</i> they words indeed, nor did it appear to be
the voice of a mare, but of one imitating a mare. And in a little time
she uttered perfect neighing, and stretched her arms upon the grass.
Then did her fingers grow together, and a smooth hoof united five nails
in one continued piece of horn. The length of her face and of her neck
increased; the greatest part of her long hair became a tail. And as the
hairs lay scattered about her neck, they were transformed into a mane
<i>lying</i> upon the right side; at once both her voice and her shape
were changed. And this wondrous change gave her the <i>new</i> name

The Centaurs, fabulous monsters, half men and half horses, were perhaps
the first horsemen in Thessaly and its neighborhood. It is also probable
that Chiron, who was one of these, acquired great fame by the knowledge
he had acquired at a time and in a country where learning was little
cultivated. The ancients regarded him as the first promulgator of the
utility of medicines, in which he was said to have instructed his pupil
Æsculapius. He was also considered to be an excellent musician and a
good astronomer, as we learn from Homer, Diodorus Siculus, and other
authors. Most of the heroes of that age, and among them Hercules and
Jason, studied under him. Very probably, the only foundation for the
story of the transformation of Ocyrrhoë, was the skill and address
which, under her father’s instruction, she acquired in riding and
<span class = "pagenum mckay">89</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">II. 708-726</span>
the management of horses. For if, as it seems really was the case, the
horsemen of that age were taken for monsters, half men and half horses,
it is not surprising to find the story that the daughter of a Centaur
was transformed into a mare.</p>

ivory and with tortoiseshell, of which thou, Pandrosos, hadst the
right-hand one, Aglauros the left-hand, and Herse had the one in the

Mercury approaching, and she ventured to ask
<span class = "pagenum mckay">91</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">II. 741-764</span>
the name of the God, and the occasion of his coming. To her thus
answered the grandson of Atlas and of Pleione: “I&nbsp;am he who carries
the commands of my father through the air. Jupiter himself is my father.
Nor will I invent pretences; do thou only be willing to be attached to
thy sister, and to be called the aunt of my offspring. Herse is the
cause of my coming; I&nbsp;pray thee to favor one in love.” Aglauros
looks upon him with the same eyes with which she had lately looked upon
the hidden mysteries of the yellow-haired Minerva, and demands for her
agency gold of great weight; <i>and</i>, in the meantime, obliges him to
go out of the house. The warlike Goddess turned upon her the orbs of her

great a motion, that she heaved both her breast and the Ægis placed

be agreeable both to the God and to the sister <i>of Aglauros</i>, and
that she would be enriched by taking the gold, which she, in her
avarice, had demanded. Forthwith she repairs to the abode of Envy,
hideous with black gore. Her abode is concealed in the lowest recesses
of a cave, wanting sun, <i>and</i> not pervious to any wind, dismal and
filled with benumbing cold; and which is ever without fire, and ever

Cicero tells us, that there were several persons in ancient times named

<p><span class = "smallcaps">When</span> the female warrior, to be

not consider it lawful to go under the roof), and she struck the

open; she sees Envy within, eating the flesh of vipers, the nutriment of
her own bad propensities; and when she sees her, she turns away her
eyes. But the other rises sluggishly from the ground, and leaves the
bodies of the serpents half devoured, and stalks along with sullen pace.
And when she sees the Goddess graced with beauty and with
<i>splendid</i> arms, she groans, and fetches a deep sigh at her
appearance. A&nbsp;paleness rests on her face, <i>and</i> leanness in
all her body; she never looks direct on you; her teeth are black with
rust; her breast is green with gall; her tongue is dripping with venom.
Smiles there are none, except such as the sight of grief has excited.
Nor does she enjoy sleep, being kept awake with watchful cares; but sees
with sorrow the successes of men, and pines away at seeing them. She
both torments and is tormented at the same moment, and is <i>ever</i>
her own punishment. Yet, though Tritonia<a class = "tag" name =

to her briefly in such words as these: “Infect one of the daughters of

she.”</p>

<p>Saying no more, she departed, and spurned the ground with her spear
impressed on it. She, beholding the Goddess as she departed, with a look
askance, uttered a few murmurs, and grieved at the success of Minerva;
and took her staff, which wreaths of thorns entirely

fields, and burns up the grass, and crops the tops <i>of the

and houses; and at last she descries the Tritonian<a class = "tag" name
= "tag2_89" id = "tag2_89" href = "#note2_89">89</a> citadel,
flourishing in arts and riches, and cheerful peace. Hardly does she
restrain her tears, because she sees nothing to weep at. But after she
has entered the chamber of the daughter of Cecrops, she executes her
orders; and touches her breast with her hand stained with rust, and
fills her heart with jagged thorns. She breathes into her as well the
noxious venom, and spreads the poison black as pitch throughout her
bones, and lodges it in the midst of her lungs.</p>

<p>And that these causes of mischief may not wander through too wide a
space, she places her sister before her eyes, and the fortunate marriage
of <i>that</i> sister, and the God under his beauteous appearance, and
aggravates each particular. By this, the daughter of Cecrops being
irritated, is gnawed by a secret grief, and groans, tormented by night,
tormented by day, and wastes away in extreme wretchedness, with a slow
consumption, as ice smitten upon by a sun often clouded. She burns at
the good fortune of the happy Herse, no otherwise than as when fire is
placed beneath thorny reeds, which do not send forth flames, and burn
with a gentle heat. Often does she wish to die, that she may not be a
witness to any such thing; often, to tell the matters, as criminal, to
her severe father. At last, she sat herself down in the front of the
threshold, in order to exclude the God when he came; to whom, as he
proffered blandishments and entreaties, and words of extreme kindness,
she said, “Cease <i>all this</i>; I&nbsp;shall not remove myself hence,
until thou art repulsed.” “Let us stand to that agreement,” says the
active Cyllenian <i>God</i>; and he opens the carved door with his wand.
But in her, as she endeavors to arise, the parts which we bend in
sitting cannot be moved, through their numbing weight. She, indeed,
struggles to raise herself, with her body,

Pausanias, in his Attica, somewhat varies this story, and says that the
daughters of Cecrops, running mad, threw themselves from the top of a
tower. It is very probable that on the introduction of the worship of
Pallas, or Minerva, into Attica, these daughters of Cecrops may have
hesitated to encourage the innovation, and the story was promulgated
that the Goddess had in that manner punished their impiety. This seems
the more likely, from the fact mentioned by Pausanias that Pandrosos,
the third daughter of Cecrops, had, after her death, a&nbsp;temple built
in honor of her, near that of Minerva, because she had continued
faithful to that Goddess, and had not disobeyed her, as her sisters had
done. The reputation and good fame of Herse and Aglauros had, however,
been restored by the time of Herodotus, since he informs us that they
both had their temples at Athens.</p>

and, in all his beauty, walks about upon the shooting grass. For his
color is that of snow, which neither the soles of hard feet have trodden

This Fable depicts one of the most famous events in the ancient
Mythology. As we have already remarked, it is supposed that there were
several persons of the name of Zeus, or Jupiter; though there is great
difficulty in assigning to each individual his own peculiar adventures.
Vossius refers the adventure of Niobe, the daughter of Phoroneus, to
Jupiter Apis, the king of Argos, who reigned about <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span> 1770; and that of Danaë to Jupiter Prœtus, who
lived about 1350 years before the Christian era. It was Jupiter
Tantalus, according to him, that carried off Ganymede; and it was
Jupiter, the father of Hercules, that deceived Leda. He says
<span class = "pagenum bell">72</span>
that the subject of the present Fable was Jupiter Asterius, who reigned
about <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span> 1400. Diodorus Siculus
tells us that he was the son of Teutamus, who, having married the
daughter of Creteus, went with some Pelasgians to settle in the island
of Crete, of which he was the first king. We may then conclude, that
Jupiter Asterius, having heard of the beauty of Europa, the daughter of
Agenor, King of Tyre, fitted out a ship, for the purpose of carrying her
off by force. This is the less improbable, as we learn from Herodotus,
that the custom of carrying those away by force, who could not be
obtained by fair means, was very common in these rude ages.</p>

The ship in which Asterius made his voyage, had, very probably, the form
of a bull for its figure-head; which, in time, occasioned those who
related the adventure, to say, that Jupiter concealed himself under the
shape of that animal, to carry off his mistress. Palæphatus and Tzetzes
<ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘suggests’">suggest</ins>, that the story took its rise from the name of
the general of Asterius, who was called Taurus, which is also the Greek
name for a bull. Bochart has an ingenious suggestion, based upon
etymological grounds. He thinks that the twofold meaning of the word
‘Alpha,’ or ‘Ilpha,’ which, in the Phœnician dialect, meant either a
ship or a bull, gave occasion to the fable; and that the Greeks, on
reading the annals of the Phœnicians, by mistake, took the word in the
latter sense.</p>

<i>Through the five direct circles.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 129. There is some
obscurity in this passage, arising from the mode of expression. Phœbus
here counsels Phaëton what track to follow, and tells him to pursue his
way by an oblique path, and not directly in the plane of the equator.
This last is what he calls ‘directos via quinque per arcus.’ These five
arcs, or circles, are the five parallel circles by which astronomers
distinguish the heavens, namely, the two polar circles, the two tropics,
and the equinoctial. The latter runs exactly in the middle, between the
other two circles, so that the expression must be understood to mean,
‘pursue not your way directly through that circle which is the
middlemost of the five, but observe the track that cuts it
obliquely.’</p>

<i>Their black hue.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 235. The notion that the blackness
of the African tribes was produced by the heat of the sun, is borrowed
by the Poet from Hesiod. Hyginus, too, says, ‘the Indians, because, by
the proximity of the fire, their blood was turned black by the heat
thereof, became of black appearance themselves.’ Notwithstanding the
learned and minute investigations of physiologists on the subject, this
question is still involved in considerable obscurity.</p>

<i>Tagus.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 251. This was a river of Spain, which was said
to bring down from the mountains great quantities of golden sand. The

<i>Passed without the sun.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 331. There is, perhaps, in
this line some faint reference to a tradition of the sun having, in the
language of Scripture, ‘stood still upon Gibeon, in his course, by the
command of Joshua, when dispensing the divine vengeance upon the
Amorites,’ Joshua, x.&nbsp;13. Or of the time when ‘the shadow returned

<i>Sthenelus.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 367. He was a king of Liguria.
Commentators have justly remarked that it was not very likely that a
king of Liguria should be related to Clymene, a&nbsp;queen of the
Ethiopians, as Ovid, in the next line, says was the case. This story was
probably invented by some writer, who fancied that there were two
persons of the name of Phaëton; one the subject of eastern tradition,
and the other a personage of the Latin mythology.</p>

<i>Trivia.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 416. This was an epithet of Diana, as
presiding over and worshipped in the places where three roads met, which
were called ‘trivia.’ Being known as Diana on earth, the Moon in the
heavens, and Proserpine in the infernal regions, she was represented at
these places with three faces; those of a horse, a&nbsp;dog, and a
female; the latter being in the middle.</p>

<p>
<a name = "note2_61" id = "note2_61" href = "#tag2_61">61.</a>
<i>Dictynna.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 441. Diana was so called from the Greek

<p>
<a name = "note2_63" id = "note2_63" href = "#tag2_63">63.</a>
<i>She of Parrhasia.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 460. Calisto is so called from
Parrhasia, a&nbsp;region of Arcadia. Parrhasius was the name of a
mountain, a&nbsp;grove, and a city of that country and was derived from
the name of Parrhasus, a&nbsp;son of Lycaon.</p>

<p>

<p>
<a name = "note2_65" id = "note2_65" href = "#tag2_65">65.</a>
<i>In front by the hair.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 476. ‘Adversâ prensis a fronte
capillis,’ is rendered by Clarke, ‘seizing her fore-top.’ Had he been
describing the combats of two fish-wives, such a version would have
been, perhaps, more appropriate than in the present instance.</p>

<p>
<a name = "note2_66" id = "note2_66" href = "#tag2_66">66.</a>
<i>With black hair.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 478. To the explanation given at the
end of the story, we may here add the curious one offered by Palæphatus.
He says that Calisto was a huntress who entered the den of a bear, by
which she was devoured; and that the bear coming out, and Calisto being
no more seen, it was reported that she had been transformed into a
bear.</p>

<p>

<i>Two-shaped.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 555. Cecrops is here so called, and in

<i>Balearic.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 727. The Baleares were the islands of
Majorca, Minorca, and Iviza, in the Mediterranean, near the coast of
Spain. The natives of these islands were famous for their skill in the
use of the sling. That weapon does not appear to have been used in the
earliest times among the Greeks, as Homer does not mention it; it had,
however, been introduced by the time of the war with Xerxes, though even
then the sling was, perhaps, rarely used as a weapon. The Acarnanians
and the Achæans of Agium, Patræ, and Dymæ were very expert in the use of
the sling. That used by the Achæans was made of three thongs of leather,
and not of one only, like those of other nations. The natives of the
Balearic isles are said to have attained their skill from the
circumstance of their mothers, when they were children, obliging them to
obtain their food by striking it, from a tree, with a sling. While other
slings were made of leather, theirs were made of rushes. Besides stones,
plummets of lead, called ‘glandes,’ (as in the present instance), and
<span class = "greek" title = "molubdides">μολύβδιδες</span>, of a form
between acorns and almonds, were cast in moulds, to be thrown from
slings. They have been frequently dug up in various parts of Greece, and
particularly on the plains of Marathon. Some have the device of a
thunderbolt; while others are inscribed with <ins class = "corr mckay"
title = "McKay reads δεζαί ‘dezai’ for ‘dexai’">δέξαι</ins>, ‘take
this.’ It was a prevalent idea with the ancients that the stone
discharged from the sling became red hot in its course, from the
swiftness of its motion.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Reverting to the history of Europa, it may be here remarked, that
Apollodorus has preserved her genealogy. Libya, according
<span class = "pagenum mckay">99</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">III. 35-48</span>
to that author, had two sons by Neptune, Belus and Agenor. The latter
married Telephassa, by whom he had Cadmus, Phœnix, and Cilix, and a
daughter named Europa. Some ancient writers, however, say, that Europa
was the daughter of Phœnix, and the grandchild of Agenor.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Some authors, and Ovid among the rest, have supposed that Europe
received its name from Europa. Bochart has, with considerable
probability, suggested that it was originally so called from the fair
complexion of the
<span class = "pagenum bell">85</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">III. 35-49</span>
people who inhabited it. Europa herself may have received her name also
from the fairness of her complexion: hence, the poets, as the Scholiast
on Theocritus tells us, invented a fable, that a daughter of Juno stole
her mother’s paint, to give it to Europa, who used it with so much
success as to ensure, by its use, an extremely fair and beautiful
complexion.</p>

<p>The sun, now at its height, had made the shadows <i>but</i> small:
the son of Agenor wonders what has detained his companion and goes to
seek his men. His garment was a skin torn from a lion; his weapon was a
lance with shining steel, and a javelin; and a courage superior to any
weapon. When he entered the grove, and beheld the lifeless bodies, and
the victorious enemy <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘in’">of</ins> immense size upon them, licking the horrid wounds with
bloodstained tongue, he said, “Either I will be the avenger of your
death, bodies <i>of my</i> faithful <i>companions</i>, or <i>I will
be</i> a sharer <i>in it</i>.” <i>Thus</i> he said; and with his right
hand he raised a huge stone,<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_8" id =
"tag3_8" href = "#note3_8">8</a> and hurled the vast <i>weight</i> with
a tremendous effort. <i>And</i> although high walls with lofty towers
would have been shaken with the shock of it, <i>yet</i> the dragon
remained without a wound; and, being defended by his scales as though
with a coat of mail, and the hardness of his black hide, he repelled the
mighty stroke with his skin. But he did not overcome the javelin as well
with the same hardness; which stood fast, fixed in the middle joint of
his yielding spine, and sank with the entire <i>point of</i> steel into
his entrails. Fierce with pain, he turned his head towards his back, and
beheld his wounds, and bit the javelin fixed there. And after he had
twisted it on every side with all his might, with difficulty he wrenched
it from his back; yet the steel
<span class = "pagenum mckay">101</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">III. 71-100</span>
stuck fast in his bones. But then, when this newly inflicted wound has
increased his wonted fury, his throat swelled with gorged veins, and
white foam flowed around his pestilential jaws. The Earth, too, scraped
with <ins class = "corr bell" title = "Bell translates ‘his’">the</ins>
scales, sounds again, and the livid steam that issues from his infernal
mouth,<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_9" id = "tag3_9" href =
"#note3_9">9</a> infects the tainted air. One while he is enrolled in
spires making enormous rings; sometimes he unfolds himself straighter
than a long beam. Now with a vast impulse, like a torrent swelled with
rain, he is borne along, and bears down the obstructing forests with his
breast. The son of Agenor gives way a little; and by the spoil of the
lion he sustains the shock, and with his lance extended before him,
pushes back his mouth, as it advances.
<span class = "pagenum bell">87</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">III. 83-112</span>
The dragon rages, and vainly inflicts wounds on the hard steel, and
fixes his teeth upon the point. And now the blood began to flow from his
poisonous palate, and had dyed the green grass with its spray. But the
wound was slight; because he recoiled from the stroke, and drew back his
wounded throat, and by shrinking prevented the blow from sinking deep,
and did not suffer it to go very far. At length, the son of Agenor,
still pursuing, pressed the spear lodged in his throat, until an oak
stood in his way as he retreated, and his neck was pierced, together
with the trunk. The tree was bent with the weight of the serpent, and
groaned at having its trunk lashed with the extremity of its tail.</p>

<p>While the conqueror was surveying the vast size of his vanquished
enemy, a&nbsp;voice was suddenly heard (nor was it easy to understand
whence <i>it was</i>, but heard it was). “Why, son of Agenor, art thou
<i>thus</i> contemplating the dragon slain <i>by thee</i>? Even thou
<i>thyself</i> shalt be seen <i>in the form of</i> a dragon.”<a class =

of terror. Lo! Pallas, the favorer of the hero, descending through the
upper region of the air, comes to him, and bids him sow the dragon’s
teeth under the earth turned up, as the seeds of a future people. He
obeyed; and when he had opened a furrow with the pressed plough, he
scattered the teeth on the ground as ordered, the seed of a race of men.
Afterwards (’tis beyond belief) the turf began to move, and first
appeared a point of a spear out of the furrows, next the coverings of
heads nodding with painted cones;<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_11" id =
"tag3_11" href = "#note3_11">11</a> then the shoulders and the breast,
and the arms laden with weapons start up, and a crop of men armed with
shields grows apace. So, when the curtains<a class = "tag" name =

joyful theaters, figures
<span class = "pagenum bell">88</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">III. 112-130</span>
are wont to rise, and first to show their countenances; by degrees the
rest; and being drawn out in a gradual continuation, the whole appear,
and place their feet on the lowest edge <i>of the stage</i>. Alarmed
with this new enemy, Cadmus is preparing to take arms, when one of the
people that the earth had produced cries out, “Do not take up
<i>arms</i>, nor engage thyself in <ins class = "corr bell" title =
"Bell translates ‘a civil war’">civil war</ins>.” And then, engaged hand
to hand, he strikes one of his earth-born brothers with the cruel sword,
<i>while</i> he himself falls by a dart sent from a distance.

<span class = "linenum mckay">III. 120-130</span>
He, also, who had put him to death, lives no longer than the other, and
breathes forth the air which he has so lately received. In a similar
manner, too, the whole troop becomes maddened, and the brothers
<i>so</i> newly sprung up, fall in fight with each other, by mutual
wounds. And now the youths that had the space of <i>so</i> short an

father, but established themselves in different countries; Cadmus
settling in Bœotia, Cilix in Cilicia, to which he gave his name, and
Phœnix, as Hyginus tells us, remaining in Africa. Photius, quoting from
Conon, the historian, informs us, that the hope of conquering some
country in Europe, and establishing a colony there, was the true ground
of the voyage of Cadmus.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Palæphatus, and other writers, say, that the Dragon which was killed by
Cadmus was a king of the country, who was named Draco, and was a son of
Mars: that his teeth were his subjects, who rallied again after their
defeat, and that Cadmus put them all to the sword, except Chthonius,
Udeus, Hyperenor, Pelor, and Echion, who became reconciled to him.
Heraclitus, however, assures us, that Cadmus really did slay a serpent,
which was very annoying to the Bœotian territory. Bochart and
Le&nbsp;Clerc are of opinion that the Fable has the following
foundation:&mdash;They say, that in the Phœnician language, the same
word signifies either the teeth of a serpent, or short javelins, pointed
with brass; that the word which signifies the number five likewise means
an army; and that probably, from these circumstances, the Fable may have
taken its rise. For the Greeks, in following the annals written in the
Phœnician language, while writing the history of the founder of Thebes,
instead of describing his soldiers as wearing helmets on their heads,
with back and breast-plates, and with darts in their
<span class = "pagenum mckay">104</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">III. 131-<ins class = "corr mckay" title =
"text reads ‘332’">132</ins></span>
hands pointed with brass, which equipment was then entirely novel in
Greece, chose rather to follow the more wonderful version, and to say,
that Cadmus had five companions produced from the teeth of a serpent;
as, according to Bochart’s suggestion, the same Phœnician phrase may
either signify a company of men sprung from the teeth of a serpent, or a
company of men armed with brazen darts.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
This conjecture is, perhaps, confirmed by a story related by Herodotus
(book ii.), which resembles it very much. He tells us, that Psammeticus,
king of Egypt, being driven to the marshy parts of his kingdom, sent to
consult the oracle of Latona, which answered that he should be restored
by brass men coming from the sea. At the time, this answer appeared to
him entirely frivolous; but certain Ionian soldiers, being obliged, some
years after, to retire to Egypt, and appearing on the shore with their
weapons and armor, all of brass, those who perceived them ran
immediately to inform the king, that men clad in brass were plundering
the country. The prince then fully comprehended the meaning of the
oracle, and making an alliance with them, recovered his throne by the
assistance they gave him. These brass men come from the sea, and those
sprung from the earth were soldiers who assisted Psammeticus and Cadmus
in carrying out their objects. Bochart’s conjecture is strengthened by
the fact, that Cadmus was either the inventor of the cuirass and
javelin, or the first that brought them into Greece. Without inquiring
further into the subject, we may conclude, that the men sprung from the
earth, or the dragon’s teeth which were sown, were the people of the
country, whom Cadmus found means to bring over to his interest; and that
they first helped him to conquer his enemies, and then to build the
citadel of Thebes, to ensure his future security. Apollodorus says that
Cadmus, to expiate the slaughter of the dragon, was obliged to serve
Mars a whole year; which year, containing eight of
<span class = "pagenum bell">90</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">III. 131-142</span>
our years, it is not improbable that Cadmus rendered services for a long
time to his new allies before he received any assistance from them.</p>

<p>There was a mountain stained with the blood of various wild beasts;

"tag" name = "tag3_18" id = "tag3_18" href = "#note3_18">18</a> sacred

counterfeited art; for she had formed a natural arch, in the native
pumice and the light sand-stones. A&nbsp;limpid fountain ran murmuring
on the right hand with its little stream, having its spreading channels
edged with a border of grass. Here, <i>when</i> wearied with hunting,

his sport till <i>next day</i>, came into the grove, wandering through
the unknown wood, with uncertain steps; thus did his fate direct
him.</p>

<p>Soon as he entered the grotto, dropping with its springs, the Nymphs,
naked as they were, on seeing a man, smote their breasts, and filled all
the woods with sudden shrieks, and gathering round Diana, covered her
with their bodies. Yet the Goddess herself was higher than they, and was
taller than them all by the neck. The color that is wont to be in
clouds, tinted by the rays of the sun <i>when</i> opposite, or that of
the ruddy morning, was on the features of Diana, when seen without her
garments. She, although surrounded with the crowd of her attendants,
stood sideways, and turned her face back; and how did she wish that she
had her arrows at hand; <i>and</i> so she took up water,<a class = "tag"

on his sprinkled head the horns of a lively stag; she adds length to his
neck, and sharpens the tops of his ears; and she changes his hands into
feet, and his arms into long legs, and covers his body with a spotted

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
If the maxim of Horace, ‘Nec Deus intersit, nisi dignus vindice nodus,’
had been a little more frequently observed by the ancient poets, their
Deities would not have been so often placed in a degrading or disgusting
light before posterity. There cannot be a better illustration of the
truth of this than the present Fable, where Ovid represents the chaste
and prudent Diana as revenging herself in a cruel and barbarous manner
for the indiscretion, or rather misfortune, of an innocent young
man.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Cicero mentions several Goddesses of the name of Diana. The first was
the daughter of Jupiter and Proserpine; the second of Jupiter and
Latona; and the third of Upis and Glauce. Strabo mentions another Diana,
named Britomartis, the daughter of Eubalus. The worship, however, of
Diana as the Goddess of the Moon, was, most probably, derived from
Egypt, with the Isis of whom she is perhaps identical. The adventure
narrated in this Fable is most probably to be attributed to Diana
Britomartis, as Strabo tells us, that she was particularly fond of the
chase. Pausanias, in his Attica, tells the story in much the same terms,
but he adds, that on seeing Diana bathing, the novelty of the sight
excited Actæon’s curiosity, and prompted him to approach nearer. To
explain this fable, some authors suggest, that Actæon’s dogs becoming
mad, devoured him; while others suppose, that having ruined himself by
the expense of supporting a large pack of hounds, and a hunting
establishment, it was reported that he had been devoured by his dogs.
Diodorus Siculus, and Euripides, tell us, that Actæon showed contempt to
Diana, and was about to eat of the sacrifice that had been offered to
her; and of course, in such a case, punishment at the hands of the
Goddess would be deemed a just retribution. Apollodorus says, that
Actæon was brought up by Chiron, and that he was put to death on Mount
Cithæron, for having seen Diana bathing; though, according to one
ancient authority, he was punished for having made improper overtures to
Semele. Apollodorus also says, that his dogs died of grief, on the loss
of their master, and he has preserved some of their names.</p>

intrigue with Jupiter, takes the form of Beroë, the more easily to
ensure her revenge. Having first infused in Semele suspicions of her

constancy. Semele, thus deceived, obtains a reluctant promise from
Jupiter, to make his next visit to her in the splendor and majesty in
which he usually approached his wife.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">They</span> speak in various ways <i>of
this matter</i>. To some, the Goddess seems more severe than is proper;
others praise her, and call her deserving <i>of her state</i> of strict
virginity: both sides find their reasons. The wife of Jupiter alone does
not so much declare whether she blames or whether she approves, as she
rejoices at the calamity of a family sprung from Agenor, and transfers
the hatred that she has conceived from the Tyrian mistress to the
partners of her race. Lo! a&nbsp;fresh occasion is <i>now</i> added to
the former one; and she grieves that Semele is pregnant from the seed of
great Jupiter. She then lets loose her tongue to abuse.</p>

<p>“And what good have I done by railing so often?” said she. “She
herself must be attacked <i>by me</i>. If I am properly called the
supreme Juno, I&nbsp;will destroy her; if it becomes me to hold the
sparkling sceptre in my right hand; if I am the queen, and both the
sister and wife of Jupiter. The sister <i>I am</i>, no doubt. But I
suppose she is content with a stolen embrace, and the injury to my bed
is but trifling. She is <i>now</i> pregnant; that <i>alone</i> was
wanting; and she bears the evidence of his crime in her swelling womb,
and wishes to be made a mother by Jupiter, a&nbsp;thing which hardly
fell to my lot alone. So great is her confidence in her beauty.

<span class = "pagenum mckay">113</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">III. 274-301</span>
Semele. Nor did she remove the clouds before she counterfeited an old

wrinkles, and moved her bending limbs with palsied step,
<span class = "pagenum bell">
<ins class = "corr bell" title = "text reads ‘96’">98</ins></span>

the Epidaurian<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_63" id = "tag3_63" href =
"#note3_63">63</a> nurse of Semele. When, therefore, upon engaging in
discourse with her, and <i>after</i> long talking, they came to the name
of Jupiter, she sighed, and said, “I&nbsp;<i>only</i> wish it may be
Jupiter; yet I <i>am apt to</i> fear everything. Many a one under the
name of a God has invaded a chaste bed. Nor yet is it enough that he is
Jupiter; let him, if, indeed, he is the real one, give some pledge of
his affection; and beg of him to bestow his caresses on thee, just in
the greatness and form in which he is received by the stately Juno; and
let him first assume his ensigns <i>of royalty</i>.” With such words did
Juno tutor the unsuspecting daughter of Cadmus. She requested of Jupiter
a favor, without naming it. To her the God said, “Make thy choice, thou
shalt suffer no denial; and that thou mayst believe it the more, let the
majesty of the Stygian stream bear witness. He <i>is</i> the dread and
the God of the Gods.”</p>

<p>Overjoyed at <i>what was</i> her misfortune, and too <i>easily</i>
prevailing, as now about to perish by the complaisance of her lover,
Semele said, “Present thyself to me, just such as the daughter of Saturn
is wont to embrace thee, when ye honor the ties of Venus.” The God
wished to shut her mouth as she spoke, <i>but</i> the hasty words had
now escaped into air. He groaned; for neither was it <i>now</i> possible
for her not to have wished, nor for him not to have sworn. Therefore, in
extreme sadness, he mounted the lofty skies, and with his nod drew along
the attendant clouds; to which he added showers and lightnings mingled
with winds, and thunders, and the inevitable thunderbolt.</p>

It is most probable, that an intrigue between a female named Semele and
one of the princes called Jupiter having had a tragical end, gave
occasion to this Fable. Pausanias, in his Laconica, tells us, that
Cadmus, exasperated against his daughter Semele, caused her and her son
to be thrown into the sea; and that being thrown ashore at Oreate, an
ancient town of Laconia, Semele was buried there.</p>

Semele, according to Apollodorus, was, after her death, ranked among the
Goddesses by the name of Thyone. He says that her son Bacchus going down
to hell, brought her thence, and carried her up to heaven; where,
according to Nonnus, she conversed with Pallas and Diana, and ate at the
same table with Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, and Venus. The author, known by
the name of Orpheus, gives Semele the title of Goddess, and <ins class =

they tell that Jupiter, by chance, well drenched with nectar, laid aside
<i>all</i> weighty cares, and engaged in some free jokes with Juno, in
her idle moments, and said: “Decidedly the pleasure of you,
<i>females</i>, is greater than that which falls to the lot of <i>us</i>
males.” She denied it. It was agreed <i>between them</i>, to ask what
was the opinion of the experienced Tiresias. To him both pleasures were
well known. For he had separated with a blow of his staff two bodies of
large serpents, as they were coupling in a green wood; and (passing
strange) <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘became’">become</ins> a woman from a man, he had spent seven autumns.
In the eighth, he again saw the same <i>serpents</i>, and said, “If the
power of a stroke given you is so great as to change the condition of
the giver into the opposite one, I&nbsp;will now strike you again.”
Having struck the same snakes, his former sex returned, and his original
shape came <i>again</i>. He, therefore, being chosen as umpire in this
sportive contest, confirmed the words of Jove. The daughter of Saturn is
said to have grieved more than was fit, and not in proportion to the
subject; and she condemned the eyes of the umpire to eternal
darkness.</p>

<p>But the omnipotent father (for it is not allowed any God to cancel
the acts of <i>another</i> Deity) gave him the knowledge of things to
come, in recompense for his loss of sight, and alleviated his punishment
by this honor.</p>

his infallible voice; whom once Cephisus encircled in his winding
stream, and offered violence to, <i>when</i> enclosed by his waters. The
most beauteous Nymph produced an infant from her teeming womb, which
even then might have been beloved, and she called him Narcissus. Being
consulted concerning him, whether he was destined to see the distant
season of mature old age; the prophet, expounding destiny, said, “If he
never recognizes himself.” Long did the words of the soothsayer appear
frivolous; <i>but</i> the event, the thing <i>itself</i>, the manner of
his death, and the novel nature of his frenzy, confirmed it.</p>

<p>And now the son of Cephisus had added one to three times five years,
and he might seem to be a boy and a young man as well. Many a youth,<a
class = "tag" name = "tag3_69" id = "tag3_69" href = "#note3_69">69</a>
and many a damsel, courted him; but there was so stubborn a pride in his
youthful beauty, <i>that</i> no youths, no damsels made any impression
on him. The noisy Nymph, who has neither learned to hold her tongue
after another speaking, nor to speak first herself, resounding Echo,
espied him, as he was driving the timid stags into his nets. Echo was
then a body, not a voice; and yet the babbler had no other use of her
speech than she now has, to be able to repeat the last words out of
many.
<span class = "pagenum mckay">117</span>

Juno had done this; because when often she might have been able to
detect the Nymphs in the mountains in the embrace of her <i>husband</i>,
Jupiter, she purposely used to detain<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_70"
id = "tag3_70" href = "#note3_70">70</a> the Goddess with a long story,
until the Nymphs had escaped. After the daughter of Saturn perceived
<i>this</i>, she said, “But small exercise of this tongue, with which I
have been deluded, shall be allowed thee, and a very short use of thy
voice.” And she confirmed her threats by the event. Still, in the end of
one’s speaking she redoubles the voice, and returns the words she hears.
When, therefore, she beheld Narcissus<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_71"
id = "tag3_71" href = "#note3_71">71</a> wandering through
<span class = "pagenum bell">102</span>

the pathless forests, and fell in love with him, she stealthily followed
his steps; and the more she followed him, with the nearer flame <ins

burn. In no other manner than as when the native sulphur, spread

to employ soft entreaties! Nature resists, and suffers her not to begin;
but what <i>Nature</i> does permit, that she is ready for; to await his
voice, to which to return her own words.</p>

<p>By chance, the youth, being separated from the trusty company of his
attendants, cries out, “Is there any one here?” and Echo answers “Here!”
He is amazed; and when he has cast his eyes on every side, he cries out
with a loud voice, “Come!” <i>Whereon</i> she calls <i>the youth</i> who
calls. He looks back; and again, as no one comes, he says, “Why dost
thou avoid me?” and just as many words as he spoke, he receives. He
persists; and being deceived by the imitation of an alternate

voice, he says, “Let us come together here;” and Echo, that could never
more willingly answer any sound whatever, replies, “Let us come together
here!” and she follows up her own words, and rushing from the woods,<a

is going to throw her arms around the neck she has <i>so</i> longed for.
He flies; and as he flies, he exclaims, “Remove thy hands from thus
embracing me; I&nbsp;will die first, before thou shalt have the
enjoyment of me.” She answers nothing but “Have the enjoyment of me.”
<i>Thus</i> rejected, she lies hid in the woods, and hides her blushing
face with green leaves, and from that time lives in lonely caves; but
yet her love remains, and increases from the mortification of her
refusal. Watchful cares waste away her miserable body; leanness shrivels
her skin, and all the juices of her body fly off in air. Her voice and
her bones alone are left.</p>

<p>Her voice <i>still</i> continues, <i>but</i> they say that her bones
received the form of stones. Since then, she lies concealed in the
woods, and is never seen on the mountains: <i>but</i> is heard in all

her.</p>

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
It appears much more reasonable to attempt the explanation of this story
on the grounds of natural philosophy than of history. The poets, in
their fondness for basing every subject upon fiction, probably invented
the fable, to explain what to them appeared an extraordinary phenomenon.
By way of embellishing their story, they tell us that Echo was the
daughter of the Air and the Tongue, and that the God Pan fell in love
with her; by which, probably, the simple fact is meant, that some
person, represented under the name of that god, endeavored to trace the
cause of this phenomenon.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
If, however, we should endeavor to base the story upon purely historical
grounds, we may suppose that it took its rise from some Nymph, who
wandered so far into the woods as to be unable to find her way out
again; and from the fact that those who went to seek her, hearing
nothing but the echo of their own voices, brought back the strange but
unsatisfactory intelligence that the Nymph had been changed into a
voice.</p>

nor she-goats feeding on the mountains, nor any other cattle, had
touched; which neither bird nor wild beast had disturbed, nor bough
falling from a tree. There was grass around it, which the neighboring
water nourished, and a wood, that suffered the stream to become warm
with no <i>rays of the</i> sun. Here the youth, fatigued both with the
labor of hunting and the
<span class = "pagenum bell">104</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">III. 413-445</span>
heat, lay down, attracted by the appearance of the spot, and the spring;
and, while he was endeavoring to quench his thirst, another thirst grew
<i>upon him</i>.</p>

<p>While he is drinking, being attracted with the reflection of his own
form, seen <i>in the water</i>, he falls in love with a thing that has
no substance; <i>and</i> he thinks that to be a body, which is
<i>but</i> a shadow. He is astonished at himself, and remains unmoved
with the same countenance, like a statue formed of Parian marble.<a

Lying on the ground, he gazes on his eyes <i>like</i> two stars, and
fingers worthy of Bacchus, and hair worthy of Apollo, and his youthful
cheeks and ivory neck, and the comeliness of his mouth, and his blushing
complexion mingled with the whiteness of snow; and everything he
admires, for which he himself is worthy to be admired. In his ignorance,
he covets himself; and he that approves, is himself <i>the thing</i>
approved. While he pursues he is pursued, and at the same moment he
inflames and burns. How often does he give vain kisses to the deceitful
spring; how often does he thrust his arms, catching at the neck he sees,
into the middle of the water, and yet he does not catch himself in them.
He knows not what he sees, but what he sees, by it is he inflamed; and
the same mistake that deceives his eyes, provokes them. Why, credulous
<i>youth</i>, dost thou vainly catch at the flying image? What thou art
seeking is nowhere; what thou art in love with, turn but away <i>and</i>
thou shalt lose it; what thou seest, the same is <i>but</i> the shadow
of a reflected form; it has nothing of its own. It comes and stays with
thee; with thee it will depart, if thou canst <i>but</i> depart
thence.</p>

<p>No regard for food,<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_76" id = "tag3_76"

thence; but, lying along upon the overshadowed grass, he gazes upon the
fallacious image with unsatiated eyes, and by his own sight he himself
is undone. Raising himself a little <i>while</i>, extending his arms to
the woods that stand around him, he says, “Was ever, O,&nbsp;ye woods!
any one more fatally in love? For <i>this</i> ye know, and have been a
convenient shelter for many a one. And do you remember any one, who
<i>ever</i> thus pined away,
<span class = "pagenum bell">105</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">III. 445-480</span>
during so long a time, though so many ages of your life has been spent?
It both pleases me and I see it; but what I see, and what pleases me,
yet I cannot obtain; so great a mistake possesses one in love; and to
make me grieve the more, neither a vast sea separates us, nor a
<i>long</i> way, nor mountains, nor a city with its gates closed; we are
kept asunder by a little water. He himself wishes to be embraced; for as
<span class = "pagenum mckay">121</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">III. 451-483</span>
often as I extend my lips to the limpid stream, so often does he
struggle towards me with his face held up; you would think he might be
touched. It is a very little that stands in the way of lovers. Whoever
thou art, come up hither. Why, <i>dear</i> boy, the choice one, dost
thou deceive me? or whither dost thou retire, when pursued? Surely,
neither my form nor my age is such as thou shouldst shun; the Nymphs,
too, have courted me. Thou encouragest I know not what hopes in me with
that friendly look, and when I extend my arms to thee, thou willingly
extendest thine; when I smile, thou smilest in return; often, too, have
I observed thy tears, when I was weeping; my signs, too, thou returnest
by thy nods, and, as I guess by the motion of thy beauteous mouth, thou
returnest words that come not to my ears. In thee ’tis&nbsp;I,
I&nbsp;<i>now</i> perceive; nor does my form deceive me. I&nbsp;burn
with the love of myself, and both raise the flames and endure them. What
shall I do? Should I be entreated, or should I entreat? What, then,
shall I entreat? What I desire is in my power; plenty has made me poor.
Oh! would that I could depart from my own body! a&nbsp;new wish,
<i>indeed</i>, in a lover; I&nbsp;could wish that what I am in love with
was away. And now grief <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘has taken’">is taking</ins> away<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_A" id =
"tag3_A" href = "#note3_A">A</a> my strength, and no long period of my
life remains; and in my early days am I cut off; nor is death grievous
to me, now about to get rid of my sorrows by death. I&nbsp;wish that he
who is beloved could enjoy a longer life. Now we two, of one mind, shall
die in <i>the extinction of</i> one life.”</p>

<p><i>Thus</i> he said, and, with his mind <i>but</i> ill at ease, he
returned to the same reflection, and disturbed the water with his tears;
and the form was rendered defaced by the moving of the stream; when he
saw it <i>beginning</i> to disappear, he cried aloud, “Whither dost thou
fly? Stay, I&nbsp;beseech thee! and do not in thy cruelty abandon thy
lover; let it be allowed me to behold that which I may not touch, and to
give nourishment to my wretched frenzy.” And, while he was grieving, he
<span class = "pagenum bell">106</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">III. 480-510</span>
tore his garment from the upper border, and beat his naked breast with
his palms, white as marble. His breast, when struck, received a little
redness, no otherwise than as
<span class = "pagenum mckay">122</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">III. 484-510</span>
apples are wont, which are partly white <i>and</i> partly red; or as a
grape, not yet ripe, in the parti-colored clusters, is wont to assume a
purple tint. Soon as he beheld this again in the water, when clear, he
could not endure it any longer; but, as yellow wax with the fire, or the
hoar frost of the morning, is wont to waste away with the warmth of the
sun, so he, consumed by love, pined away, and wasted by degrees with a
hidden flame. And now, no longer was his complexion of white mixed with
red; neither his vigor nor his strength, nor <i>the points</i> which had
charmed when seen so lately, nor <i>even</i> his body, which formerly
Echo had been in love with, now remained. Yet, when she saw these
things, although angry, and mindful <i>of his usage of her</i>, she was
grieved, and, as often as the unhappy youth said, “Alas!” she repeated,
“Alas!” with re-echoing voice; and when he struck his arms with his
hands, she, too, returned the like sound of a blow.</p>

<p>His last accents, as he looked into the water, as usual, were these:
“Ah, youth, beloved in vain!” and the spot returned just as many words;
and after he had said, “Farewell!” Echo, too, said, “Farewell!” He laid
down his wearied head upon the green grass, <i>when</i> night closed the
eyes that admired the beauty of their master; and even then, after he
had been received into the infernal abodes, he used to look at himself
in the Stygian waters. His Naiad sisters lamented him, and laid their
hair,<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_77" id = "tag3_77" href =

lamented him, <i>and</i> Echo resounded to their lamentations. And now
they were preparing the funeral pile, and the shaken torches, and the
bier. The body was nowhere <i>to be found</i>. Instead of his body, they
found a yellow flower, with white leaves encompassing it in the
middle.</p>

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
If this story is based upon any historical facts, they are entirely lost
to us; as all we learn from history concerning Narcissus, is the
<span class = "pagenum mckay">123</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">III. 511-512</span>
fact that he was a Thespian by birth. The Fable seems rather to be
intended as a
<span class = "pagenum bell">107</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">III. 511-512</span>
useful moral lesson, disclosing the fatal effects of self-love. His
pursuit, too, of his own image, ever retiring from his embrace, strongly
resembles the little reality that exists in many of those pleasures
which mankind so eagerly pursue.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Pausanias, in his Bœotica, somewhat varies the story. He tells us that
Narcissus having lost his sister, whom he tenderly loved, and who
resembled him very much, and was his constant companion in the chase,
thought, on seeing himself one day in a fountain, that it was the shade
of his lost sister, and, thereupon, pined away and died of grief.
According to him, the fountain was near a village called Donacon, in the
country of the Thespians. Pausanias regards the account of his change
into the flower which bears his name as a mere fiction, since Pamphus
says that Proserpina, when carried away, long before the time of
Narcissus, gathered that flower in the fields of Enna; and that the same
flower was sacred to her. Persons sacrificing to the Furies, or
Eumenides, used to wear chaplets made of the Narcissus, because that
flower commonly grew about graves and sepulchres.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Tiresias, who predicted the untoward fate of Narcissus, was, as we are
informed by Apollodorus, the son of Evenus and Chariclo, and was the
most renowned soothsayer of his time. He lost his life by drinking of
the fountain of Telphusa when he was overheated; or, as some suppose,
through the unwholesome quality of the water. As he lived to a great
age, and became blind towards the end of his life, the story, which Ovid
mentions, was invented respecting him. Another version of it was, that
he lost his sight, by reason of his having seen Minerva while bathing.
This story was very probably based either upon the fact that he had
composed a Treatise upon the Animal Functions of the Sexes, or that he
had promulgated the doctrine that the stars had not only souls
(a&nbsp;common opinion in those times), but also that they were of
different sexes. He is supposed to have lived about 1200 years before
the Christian era.</p>

companions, Bacchus suffers that indignity, and relates to Pentheus the

of the Gods above, alone, of all men, despises him, and derides the
predicting words of the old man, and upbraids him with his darkened
state, and the misfortune of <i>having lost</i> his sight. He, shaking
his temples, white with hoary hair, says: “How fortunate wouldst thou
be, if thou as well couldst become deprived of this light, that thou
mightst not behold the rites of Bacchus. For soon the day will come, and
even now I predict that it is not far off, when the new <i>God</i>
Liber, the son of Semele, shall come hither. Unless thou shalt vouchsafe
him the honor of a temple, thou shalt be scattered, torn in pieces, in a

and thy mother and the sisters of thy mother. <i>These things</i> will
come to pass; for thou wilt not vouchsafe honor to the Divinity; and
thou wilt complain that under this darkness I have seen too much.”</p>

Confirmation follows his words, and the predictions of the prophet are
fulfilled. Liber comes, and the fields resound with festive howlings.

and more violent from its obstruction. Behold! <i>the servants</i>
return, all stained with blood; and when their master inquires where
Bacchus is, they deny that they have seen Bacchus. “But this one,” say
they, “we have taken, who was his attendant and minister in his sacred

“O&nbsp;<i>wretch</i>, doomed to destruction, and about, by thy death,
to set an example to others, tell me thy name, and the name of thy
parents, and thy country, and why thou dost attend the sacred rites of a

shore by <i>plying</i> the oars on the right side;
<span class = "pagenum bell">112</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">III. 599-632</span>
and I gave a nimble leap, and lighted upon the wet sand. When the night
was past, and the dawn first began to grow red, I&nbsp;arose and ordered
<i>my men</i> to take in fresh water, and I pointed out the way which
led to the stream. I&nbsp;myself, from a lofty eminence, looked around
<i>to see</i> what the breeze promised me; and <i>then</i> I called my
companions, and returned to the vessel. ‘Lo! we are here,’ says <ins
class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘Ophletes’">Opheltes</ins>, my
chief mate; and having found, as he thought, a&nbsp;prize in the lonely
fields, he was leading along the shore, a&nbsp;boy with <i>all</i> the
beauty of a girl. He, heavy with wine and sleep, seemed to stagger, and
to follow with difficulty. I&nbsp;examined his dress, his looks, and his
gait, <i>and</i> I saw nothing there which could be taken to be mortal.
I&nbsp;both was sensible of it, and I said to my companions, ‘I am in
doubt what Deity is in that body; but in that body a Deity there is.
Whoever thou art, O&nbsp;be propitious and assist our toils; and pardon
these as well.’ ‘Cease praying for us,’ said Dictys, than whom there was
not another more nimble at climbing to the main-top-yards, and at
sliding down by catching hold of a rope. This Libys, this the

rest; so blind is the greed for booty. ‘However,’
<span class = "pagenum mckay">129</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">III. 621-648</span>
I said, ‘I will not allow this ship to be damaged by this sacred
freight. Here I have the greatest share of right.’ and I opposed them at
the entrance.</p>

<p>“Lycabas, the boldest of all the number, was enraged, who, expelled
from a city of Etruria, was suffering exile as the punishment for a
dreadful murder.<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_92" id = "tag3_92" href =
"#note3_92">92</a> He, while I was resisting, seized hold of my throat
with his youthful fist, and shaking me, had thrown me overboard into the
sea, if I had not, although stunned, held fast by grasping a rope. The
impious crew approved of the deed. Then at last Bacchus (for Bacchus it
was), as though his sleep had been broken by the noise, and his sense
was returning into his breast after <i>much</i> wine, said: ‘What are
you doing? What is this noise? Tell me, sailors,
<span class = "pagenum bell">113</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">III. 632-665</span>
by what means have I come hither? Whither do you intend to carry me?’
‘Lay aside thy fears,’ said Proreus, ‘and tell us what port thou wouldst
wish to reach. Thou shalt stop at the land that thou desirest.’ ‘Direct
your course then to Naxos,’<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_93" id =
"tag3_93" href = "#note3_93">93</a> says Liber, ‘that is my home; it
shall prove a hospitable land for you.’</p>

<p>“In their deceit they swore by the ocean and by all the Deities, that
so it should be; and bade me give sail to the painted ship. Naxos was to
our right; <i>and</i> as I was <i>accordingly</i> setting sail for the
right hand, every one said for himself, ‘What art thou about, madman?
What insanity possesses thee, Acœtes? Stand away to the left.’ The
greater part signified <i>their meaning</i> to me by signs; some
whispered in my ear what they wanted. I&nbsp;was at a loss, and I said,
‘Let some one else take the helm;’ and I withdrew myself from the
execution both of their wickedness, and of my own calling. I&nbsp;was
reviled by them all, and the whole crew muttered <i>reproaches</i>
against me. Æthalion, among them, says, ‘As if, forsooth, all our safety
is centred in thee,’ and he himself comes up, and takes my duty;
<span class = "pagenum mckay">130</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">III. 649-678</span>
and leaving Naxos, he steers a different course. Then the God, mocking
them as if he had at last but that moment discovered their knavery,
looks down upon the sea from the crooked stern; and, like one weeping,
he says: ‘These are not the shores, sailors, that you have promised me;
this is not the land desired by me. By what act have I deserved this
treatment? What honor is it to you, if you <i>that are</i> young men,
deceive a <i>mere</i> boy? if you <i>that are</i> many, deceive me,
<i>who am but</i> one?’ I had been weeping for some time. The impious
gang laughed at my tears, and beat the sea with hastening oars. Now by
himself do I swear to thee (and no God is there more powerful than he),
that I am relating things to thee as true, as they are beyond all
belief. The ship stood still upon the ocean, no otherwise than if it was
occupying a dry dock. They, wondering at it, persisted in the plying of
their oars; they unfurled their sails, and endeavored to speed onward
with this twofold aid. Ivy impeded the oars,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag3_94" id = "tag3_94" href = "#note3_94">94</a> and twined <i>around
them</i> in encircling wreaths; and
<span class = "pagenum bell">114</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">III. 665-699</span>
clung to the sails with heavy clusters of berries. He himself, having
his head encircled with bunches of grapes, brandished a lance covered
with vine leaves. Around him, tigers and visionary forms of lynxes, and
savage bodies of spotted panthers, were extended.</p>

<p>“The men leaped overboard, whether it was madness or fear that caused
this; and first <i>of all</i>, Medon began to grow black with fins, with
a flattened body, and to bend in the curvature of the back-bone. To him
Lycabas said, ‘Into what prodigy art thou changing?’ and, as he spoke,
the opening of his mouth was wide, his nose became crooked, and his
hardened skin received scales upon it. But Libys, while he was
attempting to urge on the resisting oars, saw his hands shrink into a
small compass, and now to be hands no longer, <i>and</i> that now, <i>in
fact</i>, they may be pronounced fins. Another, desirous
<span class = "pagenum mckay">131</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">III. 679-708</span>
to extend his arms to the twisting ropes, had no arms, and becoming
crooked, with a body deprived of limbs, he leaped into the waves; the
end of his tail was hooked, just as the horns of the half-moon are
curved. They flounce about on every side, and bedew <i>the ship</i> with
plenteous spray, and again they emerge, and once more they return
beneath the waves. They sport with <i>all</i> the appearance of a dance,
and toss their sportive bodies, and blow forth the sea, received within
their wide nostrils. Of twenty the moment before (for so many did that
ship carry), I&nbsp;was the only one remaining. The God encouraged me,
frightened and chilled with my body all trembling, and scarcely myself,
saying, ‘Shake off thy fear, and make for Dia.’ Arriving there,
I&nbsp;attended upon the sacred rites of Bacchus, at the kindled
altars.”</p>

<p>“We have lent ear to a long story,”<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_95"
id = "tag3_95" href = "#note3_95">95</a> says Pentheus, “that our anger
might consume its strength in its tediousness. Servants! drag him
headlong, and send to Stygian night his body, racked with dreadful
tortures.” At once the Etrurian Acœtes, dragged away, is shut up in a
strong prison; and while the cruel instruments of the death that is
ordered, and the iron and the fire are being made ready, the report is
that the doors
<span class = "pagenum bell">115</span>
<span class = "linenum bell">III. 699-730</span>
opened of their own accord, and that the chains, of their own accord,
slipped from off his arms, no one loosening them.</p>

<p>The son of Echion persists: and now he does not command others to go,
but goes himself to where Cithæron,<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_96" id
= "tag3_96" href = "#note3_96">96</a> chosen for the celebration of
these sacred rites, was resounding with singing, and the shrill voices
of the votaries of Bacchus. Just as the high-mettled steed neighs, when
the warlike trumpeter gives the alarm with the sounding brass, and
conceives a desire for battle, so did the sky, struck with the
long-drawn howlings, excite Pentheus, and his wrath was rekindled on
hearing the clamor. There was, about the middle
<span class = "pagenum mckay">132</span>
<span class = "linenum mckay">III. 708-733</span>
of the mountain, the woods skirting its extremity, a&nbsp;plain free
from trees, <i>and</i> visible on every side. Here his mother was the
first to see him looking on the sacred rites with profane eyes; she
first was moved by a frantic impulse, <i>and</i> she first wounded her
<i>son</i>, Pentheus, by hurling her thyrsus, <i>and</i> cried out, “Ho!
come, my two sisters;<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_97" id = "tag3_97"
href = "#note3_97">97</a> that boar which, of enormous size, is roaming
amid our fields, that boar I must strike.” All the raging multitude
rushes upon him alone; all collect together, and all follow him, now
trembling, now uttering words less atrocious <i>than before</i>, now
blaming himself, now confessing that he <ins class = "corr mckay" title
= "McKay reads ‘had’">has</ins> offended.</p>

<p>However, on being wounded, he says, “Give me thy aid, Autonoë, my
aunt; let the ghost of Actæon<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_98" id =
"tag3_98" href = "#note3_98">98</a> influence thy feelings.” She knows
not what Actæon <i>means</i>, and tears away his right hand as he is
praying; the other is dragged off by the violence of Ino. The wretched
<i>man</i> has <i>now</i> no arms to extend to his mother; but showing
his maimed body, with the limbs torn off, he says, “Look at this, my
mother!” At the sight Agave howls aloud, and tosses her neck, and shakes
her locks in the air; and seizing his head, torn off, with her
blood-stained fingers, she cries out, “Ho! my companions, this victory
is our work!”</p>

<p>The wind does not more speedily bear off, from a lofty tree, the
leaves nipped by the cold of autumn, and now adhering

<span class = "linenum bell">III. 730-733</span>
with difficulty, than were the limbs of the man, torn asunder by their
accursed hands. Admonished by such examples, the Ismenian matrons
frequent the new worship, and offer frankincense, and reverence the
sacred altars.</p>

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
Cicero mentions two Deities of the name of Bacchus; while other authors
speak of several of that name. The first was the son of
<span class = "pagenum mckay">133</span>
Jupiter and Proserpina; the second was the son of the Nile, and the
founder of the city of Nysa, in Arabia; Caprius was the father of the
third. The fourth was the son of the Moon and Jupiter, in honor of whom
the Orphic ceremonies were performed. The fifth was the son of Nisus and
Thione, and the instituter of the Trieterica. Diodorus Siculus mentions
but three of the name of Bacchus; namely, the Indian, surnamed the
bearded Bacchus, who conquered India; the son of Jupiter and Ceres, who
was represented with horns; and the son of Jupiter and Semele, who was
called the Theban Bacchus.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The most reasonable opinion seems to be that of Herodotus and Plutarch,
who inform us, that the true Bacchus, and the most ancient of them all,
was born in Egypt, and was originally called Osiris. The worship of that
Divinity passed from Egypt to Greece, where it received great
alterations; and, according to Diodorus Siculus, it was Orpheus who
introduced it, and made those innovations. In gratitude to the family of
Cadmus, from which he had received many favors, he dedicated to Bacchus,
the grandson of Cadmus, those mysteries which had been instituted in
honor of Osiris, whose worship was then but little known in Greece.
Diodorus Siculus says, that as Semele was delivered of Bacchus in the
seventh month, it was reported that Jupiter shut him up in his thigh, to
carry him there the remaining time of gestation. This Fable was probably
founded on the meaning of an equivocal word. The Greek word <span class
= "greek" title = "mêros">μηρὸς</span> signifies either ‘a thigh,’ or
‘the hollow of a mountain.’ Thus the Greeks, instead of saying that
Bacchus had been nursed on Mount Nysa, in Arabia, according to the
Egyptian version of the story, published that he had been carried in the
thigh of Jupiter.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
As Bacchus applied himself to the cultivation of the vine, and taught
his subjects several profitable and necessary arts, he was honored as a
Divinity; and having won the esteem of many neighboring countries, his
worship soon spread. Among his several festivals there was one called
the Trieterica, which was celebrated every three years. In that feast
the Bacchantes carried the figure of the God in a chariot drawn by two
tigers, or panthers; and, crowned with vine leaves, and holding thyrsi
in their hands, they ran in a frantic manner around the chariot, filling
the air with the noise of tambourines and brazen instruments, shouting
‘Evoë. Bacche!’ and calling the God by his several names of Bromius,
Lyæus, Evan, Lenæus, and Sabazius. To this ceremonial, received from the
Egyptians, the Greeks added other ceremonies replete with abominable
licentiousness, and repulsive to common decency. These were often
suppressed by public enactment, but were as often re-established by the
votaries of
<span class = "pagenum bell">117</span>
lewdness and immodesty, and such as found in these festivals a pretext
and opportunity for the commission of the most horrible offences.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The story of the unfortunate fate of Pentheus is supposed by the ancient
writers to have been strictly true. Pentheus, the son of Echion and
Agave, the daughter of Cadmus, having succeeded his grandfather in his
kingdom, is supposed, like him, to have opposed those abuses that had
crept into the mysteries of Bacchus, and went to Mount Cithæron for the
purpose of chastising the Bacchantes, who were celebrating his festival;
whereupon, in their
<span class = "pagenum mckay">134</span>
frantic madness, the worshippers, among whom were his mother and his
aunt, tore him <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘to’">in</ins> pieces. <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘Pausanius’">Pausanias</ins>, however, says that Pentheus really was a
wicked prince; and he somewhat varies his story, as he tells us that
having got into a tree to overlook the secret ceremonies of the orgies,
Pentheus was discovered by the Bacchantes, who punished his curiosity by
putting him to death. The story of the transformation of the mariners is
supposed by <ins class = "corr mckay" title = "McKay reads ‘Bochârt’">Bochart</ins> to have been founded on the adventure of
certain merchants from the coast of Etruria, whose vessel had the figure
of a dolphin at the prow, or rather of the fish called ‘tursio,’
probably the porpoise, or sea-hog. They were probably shipwrecked near
the Isle of Naxos, which was sacred to Bacchus, whose mysteries they had
perhaps neglected, or even despised. On this slender ground, perhaps,
the report spread, that the God himself had destroyed them, as a
punishment for their impiety.</p>

certain serpents have of fascinating their prey by the agency of the
eye, and thus depriving it of the means of escape.</p>

<i>When the curtains.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 111. The ‘Siparium’ was a piece of
tapestry stretched on a frame, and, rising before the stage, answered
the same purpose as the curtain or drop-scene with us, in concealing the
stage till the actors appeared. Instead of drawing up this curtain to
discover the stage and actors, according to our present practice, it was
depressed when the play began, and fell beneath the level of the stage;
whence ‘aulæa premuntur,’ ‘the curtain is dropped,’ meant that the play
had commenced. When the performance was finished, this was raised again
gradually from the foot of the stage; therefore ‘aulæa tolluntur,’ ‘the
curtain is raised,’ would mean that the play had finished. From the
present passage we learn, that in drawing it up from the stage, the
curtain was gradually displayed, the unfolding taking place, perhaps,
below the boards, so that the heads of the figures rose first, until the
whole form appeared in full with the feet resting on the stage, when the
‘siparium’ was fully drawn up. From a passage in Virgil’s Georgics (book
iii. l. 25), we learn that the figures of Britons (whose country had
then lately been the scene of new conquests) were woven on the canvas of
the ‘siparium,’ having their arms in the attitude of lifting the
curtain.</p>

daughters were four in number, Autonoë, Ino, Semele, and Agave. Ino

he recollected this wise saying of Solon, and by that means saved his
life, as we are told by Herodotus, who relates the story at length.
Euripides has a similar passage in his Troades, line 510.</p>

called their dogs. The pack of Actæon is said to have consisted of fifty
dogs. Their names were preserved by several Greek poets, from whom
Apollodorus copied them; but the greater part of his list has perished,
and what remains is in a very corrupt state. Hyginus has preserved two
lists, the first of which contains thirty-nine names, most of which are
similar to those here given by Ovid, and in almost the same order; while
the second contains thirty-six names, different from those here given.
Æschylus has named but four of them, and Ovid here names thirty-six.

some that he alludes to the jackal. Perhaps, from this animal, the dog

carried by Bacchus, and by the Satyrs and Bacchanalians engaged in the
worship of the God of the grape. It was sometimes terminated by the
apple of the pine, or fir-cone, the fir-tree being esteemed sacred to
Bacchus, from the turpentine flowing therefrom and its apples being used
in making wine. It is, however, frequently represented as terminating in
a knot of ivy, or vine leaves, with grapes or berries arranged in a
conical form. Sometimes, also, a&nbsp;white fillet was tied to the pole
just below the head. We learn from Diodorus Siculus, and Macrobius, that
Bacchus converted the thyrsi carried by himself and his followers into
weapons, by concealing an iron point in the head of leaves. A&nbsp;wound
with its point was supposed to produce madness.</p>

<i>Engines of war.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 549. ‘Tormenta.’ These were the
larger engines of destruction used in ancient warfare. They were so
called from the verb ‘torqueo,’ ‘to twist,’ from their being formed by
the twisting of hair, fibre, or strips of leather. The different sorts
were called ‘balistæ’ and ‘catapultæ.’ The former were used to impel
stones; the latter, darts and arrows. In sieges, the ‘Aries,’ or
‘battering ram,’ which received its name from having an iron head
resembling that of a ram, was employed in destroying the lower part of
the wall, while the ‘balista’ was overthrowing the battlements, and the
‘catapulta’ was employed to shoot any of the besieged who appeared
between them. The ‘balistæ’ and ‘catapultæ’ were divided into the
‘greater’ and the ‘less.’ When New Carthage, the arsenal of the
Carthaginians, was taken, according to Livy (b. xxvi. c. 47), there were
found in it 120 large and 281 small catapultæ, and twenty-three large
and fifty-two small balistæ. The various kinds of ‘tormenta’ are said to
have been introduced about the time of Alexander the Great. If so, Ovid
must here be committing an anachronism, in making Pentheus speak of
‘tormenta,’ who lived so many ages before that time. To commit
anachronisms with impunity seems, however, to be the poet’s privilege,
from Ovid downwards to our Shakspere, where he makes Falstaff talk
familiarly of the West Indies. We find the dictionaries giving
‘tormentum’ as the Latin word for ‘cannon;’ so that in this case we may
say not that ‘necessity is the mother of invention,’ but rather that she
is ‘the parent of anachronism.’</p>

<i>Acrisius.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 559. He was a king of Argos, the son of
Abas, and the father of Danaë. He refused, and probably with justice, to
admit Bacchus or his rites within the gates of his city.</p>

and being the husband of Ino, was the son-in-law of Cadmus; who being
the father of Agave, the mother of Pentheus, is the grandfather
mentioned in the present line.</p>

<i>Mæonia.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 583. Colonists were said to have proceeded
from Lydia, or Mæonia, to the coasts of Etruria. Bacchus assumes the
name of Acœtes, as corresponding to the Greek epithet <ins class = "corr
mckay" title = "McKay reads ἁκόιτης ‘hakoitês’ for ‘akoitês’">ἀκοίτης</ins>, ‘watchful,’ or ‘sleepless;’ which ought to be

<i>Olenian she-goat.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 594. Amalthea, the goat that
suckled Jupiter, is called Olenian, either because she was reared in
Olenus, a&nbsp;city of Bœotia, or because she was placed as a
Constellation between the arms, <ins class = "corr both" title = "both texts read ώλήναι ‘ôlênai’ for ‘ôlenai">ὠλέναι</ins>, of the
Constellation Auriga, or the Charioteer. The rising and setting of this

Bacchus, whom Jupiter, as a mark of his favor, placed in the number of

<i>Dia.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 596. This was another name of the Isle of Naxos.
Gierig thinks that the reading here is neither ‘Diæ’ nor ‘Chiæ,’ which
are the two common readings; as the situation of neither the Isle of
Naxos nor that of Chios, would suit the course of the ship, as stated in
the text. He thinks that the Isle of Ceos, or Cea, is meant, which
Ptolemy calls <span class = "greek" title = "Kia">Κια</span>, and which
he thinks ought here to be written ‘Ciæ.’</p>

<i>Ivy impeded the oars.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 664. Hyginus tells us, that
Bacchus changed the oars into thyrsi, the sails into clusters of grapes,
and the rigging into ivy branches. In the Homeric hymn on this subject
we find the ship flowing with wine, vines growing on the sails, ivy
twining round the mast, and the benches wreathed with chaplets.</p>

mother of Actæon, to remember the sad fate of her own son, and to show
him some mercy; but in vain: for, as one commentator on the passage
says, ‘Drunkenness had taken away both her reason and her memory.’</p>
